What is Alphatk?

Alphatk is a text editor.  It's most useful for programmers, those
writing a lot of TeX or LaTeX documents, and for editing of HTML source
files.  It has very rich features to aid in writing and editing files of
those document types.  The programming languages most strongly supported
are C, C++, Java, Tcl, Perl, Matlab, in addition to LaTeX and CSS/HTML.
Most other common languages (around 50!)  are also supported, although
perhaps not with quite such a rich feature set.  As well as being useful
for creating and editing such documents, Alphatk provides a host of
facilities for communicating with compilers, diff, patch, version control
systems, ftp sites, web sites, etc.

Alphatk is a little like emacs, in that it is a very powerful text editor.
However it was designed with a graphical interface in mind, which can make
it rather more mouse-friendly, and less reliant on cryptic keystrokes
(although any action can be bound to any key combination so those who don't
use a mouse much will still be happy!).  Alphatk has a very rich feature
set.

Alphatk runs on Windows, Unix and MacOS X, so you can use the same editor on
all your platforms.

Alphatk comes as a 45 day unlimited, fully-functional demo.  After that
you must purchase a license key.  You can do so at
<http://order.kagi.com/?1GU>.

New releases will be made as frequently as is necessary to keep up with
bug reports and feature requests.  Bug fixes and code contributions are
much appreciated.

Alphatk would never have existed had it not been for Pete Keleher, the
creator of 'Alpha', a MacOS only editor, and for the community of Alpha
users who have contributed vast amounts of Tcl code which help make
Alphatk the powerful editor it now is.

Alphatk is supported on any platform on which Tk 8.4 or newer runs.  This
means it should run smoothly on any Windows, Unix or MacOS X system!
Beyond the pre-packaged executables, the alphatk.tar.gz/alphatk.zip
non-executable distributions are known to run on:

    Windows NT 4.0sp3,sp5,sp6, with any 8.4.x
    Windows 2000sp1/2 with any Tcl 8.4.x
    Windows XP with Tcl 8.4.x
    Solaris running X-windows, with Tcl/Tk 8.4
    RedHat Linux with Tcl/Tk 8.4.x
    MacOS X with Tk on Aqua 8.4.x
    MacOS X with Tcl/Tk 8.4.x and DarwinX

Tcl/Tk 8.5a3 also works very well.
