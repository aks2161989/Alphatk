License terms
-------------

The core Alphatk implementation (all files in the AlphatkCore directory and
its subdirectories) is Copyright (c) 1998-2003 Vincent Darley.  All rights
are reserved to this code, with the exception of those few pieces which
carry other explicit license agreements.  That code cannot be copied, or
distributed in full or in part, in any form, EXCEPT as part of a complete
Alphatk distribution, carrying this exact license.

Alphatk may be distributed, without charge, provided it is distributed
as a complete distribution (archived in whatever way is convenient).  A
complete distribution is the entire Alphatk folder and all of its
(recursive) contents.

The use of Alphatk is governed by purchased licenses.  The standard single
license may be used either as 'per human' or as 'per computer' but not both.
For example, a single user can install Alphatk on multiple personal machines
for their own personal use, or it can be installed on one machine for use by
multiple users.  Therefore, concurrent use of Alphatk by more than one user
(presumably on more than one machine) requires the purchase of additional
licenses.  "Site" and "Worldwide" licenses provide for unlimited concurrent
users at either a single location or multiple locations, respectively.

The following terms apply to all files in the core Alphatk software
unless explicitly disclaimed in individual files.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY
FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, ITS DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY
DERIVATIVES THEREOF, EVEN IF THE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

THE AUTHORS AND DISTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  THIS SOFTWARE
IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND THE AUTHORS AND DISTRIBUTORS HAVE
NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, UPDATES, ENHANCEMENTS, OR
MODIFICATIONS.

GOVERNMENT USE: If you are acquiring this software on behalf of the
U.S. government, the Government shall have only "Restricted Rights"
in the software and related documentation as defined in the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations (FARs) in Clause 52.227.19 (c) (2).  If you
are acquiring the software on behalf of the Department of Defense, the
software shall be classified as "Commercial Computer Software" and the
Government shall have only "Restricted Rights" as defined in Clause
252.227-7013 (c) (1) of DFARs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
authors grant the U.S. Government and others acting in its behalf
permission to use and distribute the software in accordance with the
terms specified in this license.
