The Enhanced Text Widget
------------------------

Main external interfaces:

tw::Hook (well defined)
tw::Colour (less well defined)
tw::MakeWindow (well defined)
tw::Toolbar (well defined)
tw::Set (well defined)
tw::GetColorTags (well defined)

Also the '$colouring' variable is used as a global flag.

$alpha::modifier_keys is used to determine appropriate bindings.

Also: alpha::haveDnd

----

Beyond the above issues, the enhanced text widget is completely independent
of the rest of Alphatk.  But please note that this code is not free.  Any
use outside of the Alphatk package is not permitted at present --- but if
you'd like to be able to embed this inside something else, please ask me.
