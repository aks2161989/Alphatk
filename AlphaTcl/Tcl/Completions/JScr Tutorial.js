	  	/* Abstract */

This document provides examples of JScr mode electric completions.


	  	/* Tutorial */

This file contains examples of "electric completions".  Completions are
ways in which Alpha attempts to complete what you're typing in a mode
specific way (here we are considering the JavaScript specific way).

The " Config --> Special Keys ... " menu item will display your current
completion key-binding (default is ctrl-tab), and will give you the option
to change it if you desire.

In this tutorial, you can use the back-quote key ( ` ) to jump to the next
completion example. (Hit ` and then space if ` is a dead key on your
keyboard.) Once at the correct position, imagine that you had just typed
the preceding text.

Then hit the completion invoking key (default is ctrl-tab). Alpha attempts
to complete what you typed -- eliminating a lot of keystrokes.

In JavaScript mode completions of a number of statements are available. Try
them below.


	function×
	
	for×
	
	while×
	
	switch×
	
	switch (){
	  case×
	}
	
	do×
	
	if×
	
	if (a == 5){
		c = 2;
	} else×
