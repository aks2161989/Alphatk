		<!-- Abstract -->

This document provides examples of HTML mode electric completions.

		<!-- Introduction -->

This file contains examples of "electric completions".  Completions are
ways in which Alpha attempts to complete what you're typing in a mode
specific way (here we are considering the HTML specific way).

The " Config --> Special Keys ... " menu item will display your current
completion key-binding (default is ctrl-tab), and will give you the option
to change it if you desire.

In this tutorial, you can use the back-quote key ( ` ) to jump to the next
completion example. (Hit ` and then space if ` is a dead key on your
keyboard.) Once at the correct position, imagine that you had just typed
the preceding text.

Then hit the completion invoking key (default is ctrl-tab). Alpha attempts
to complete what you typed -- eliminating a lot of keystrokes.

		<!-- Completing Elements -->

Alpha will try to complete the beginning of an opening tag to a complete
HTML element, as well as completing the beginning of a closing tag. Try the
ones below.

	<ta×
	<par×
	<fr×
	</blo×

There are three preferences which determine how Alpha behaves when you make
the completions. 

On page 2 in the General HTML mode preference dialog box there is an option
"Open attribute dialog after completing an element". If this is active,
Alpha will open the attribute dialog if there are any attributes to ask
about. Clicking Cancel in the attribute dialog leaves the insertion point
inside the opening tag, while clicking OK moves the insertion point to the
template stop between the tags.

On the same page there is an option "Adjust current line indentation when
inserting a template". If this is active, Alpha adjusts the indentation of
the current line when inserting a template at the beginning of the line.
		
The third preference which changes Alpha's behavior is the option "List
Pick If Mult Cmps", which you find in the dialog box
"Config:Preferences:Completions". If this is active, Alpha will open a
list dialog box if the completion is not unique.

Change these preferences and try the same completions again.

		<!-- Completing Attributes -->

Alpha can also complete the attribute names. Try the following examples.

	<p al×>
	<td row×>
	<select mul×>
	<table cell×>

Also in this case the option "List Pick If Mult Cmps" will determine if
Alpha will open a list dialog box, when the completion is not unique.

	<!-- Completing Attribute Values -->

Alpha can also complete the attribute names, e.g. if the attribute can take
values in a list of predefined values, or the attribute is a color or a
URL. Try the following examples.

	<p align="c×">
	<link type="t×">
	<body bgcolor="ye×">
	<a href="×">
