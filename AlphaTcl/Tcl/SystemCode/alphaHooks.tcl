 # Description: 
 #  
 # This file contains most of the Tcl procedures which are called by
 # Alpha/Alphatk internally.  As such you should be very careful making any
 # changes to these procedures.
 #  
 # See "Extending Alpha" for lists of available hooks and further
 # documentation on them.
 #  
 # Use [hook::register] to attach code to any of these procedures.

 # 18/7/97   VMD 1.0 original
 # 22/7/97   VMD 1.1 fixed all bugs ;-) and added the above examples.
 # 4/2/04    VMD 2.0 total overhaul, with support for composite modes
 # 2005-01-21 VMD 2.1 added support for hidden windows, and much 
 #    cleanup, simplification, also more robust through use of the

# ◊◊◊◊ Window opening sequence ◊◊◊◊ #

# Clients of the AlphaTcl library should call things as follows:
# 
# (1) Before opening a file window, the first step is to call
# 'filePreOpeningHook $filename $winname'  (this step is obviously
# skipped for non-file windows).
# 
# (2) When the window is created, and the appropriate structures
# are in place (so 'setWinInfo' works) call 'winCreatedHook $winname'
# (in Alphatk at least it is called after the window's contents
# are in place, but while the window is in a withdrawn state).  This
# will add the window to the list of known AlphaTcl windows (at the
# end of the list).
# 
# (3) Finally call 'registerWindowWithAlphaTcl' which will itself call
# 'alpha::openHook', 'windowVisibility' (which will normally call
# 'bringToFront' (which calls 'activateHook')), 'alpha::afterOpening'.
#
#
# We support the creation of windows which are hidden or iconified (and
# therefore not frontmost in the editor).  This is done by setting the
# 'visibility' attribute of a window early in its creation (typically by
# '-visibility <state>' being passed to edit/new).  There are three
# possible values: normal, hidden or minimized.  In the 'normal' case
# the window is brought to front (and becomes [win::Current]) , but in
# the other two cases the new window is left at the end of the list of
# open windows.
#
# Current development code is available to provide better support for
# hidden and iconified windows, which implies a mode="" even when we
# have open windows if none of them are normal windows.  This requires
# the ability for things like the status bar menus to disappear even
# though we have open windows (just when all of them are
# iconified/hidden).  Alphatk supports this at present.  It needs 
# testing with Alpha 8/X.

 #  'winname' is the name of the window we will use (e.g. it may have
 #  trailing <2>...), but that window will not yet exist at all.
 #  
 #  The idea is that we can use this proc and the hooks it calls
 #  to set the window's mode, to adjust tab-size, encoding, etc, before
 #  the window is properly created, and before the contents of the
 #  file are read in (this is particularly important if we want to
 #  set a particular encoding to use for that reading!).  We call
 #  'win::setInitialConfig' with the future name of the window when we
 #  want to set any of these details.

 # "winCreatedHook" --
 # 
 #  Called by Alpha(tk)'s core as soon as the window structures are
 #  created so that 'setWinInfo' can work.
 #  
 #  Note that, in most respects, the window does not yet exist, but the
 #  contents of the window are probably already known and fixed,
 #  although they are not accessible to this procedure (e.g. if it is a
 #  file on disk, we do *not* have an opportunity here to influence the
 #  encoding with which that is read, but, for example, we could change
 #  the tabsize here, before the window is shown to the user).
 #  
 #  Really the _only_ thing this procedure should do to the window
 #  is call win::setInfo.
 #  
 #  This proc can be used to set any characteristics of the window
 #  which we somehow determined were necessary while it was being
 #  opened/created (e.g. mode-dependent values).
 #  
 #  IMPORTANT: When this proc is called (or immediately on its return)
 #  the new window should exist in the 'winNames -f' list.  This
 #  means we must synchronise everything in AlphaTcl for the existence
 #  of this window.  This is handled by win::created.
 #  
 #  Any window that passes through 'winCreatedHook' _must_ eventually
 #  end up in closeHook when it is destroyed (even if an internal error
 #  occurs after winCreatedHook which aborts the window creation, the
 #  core must still call closeHook if AlphaTcl is to maintain a 
 #  consistent state).

 #  This function will be called (by registerWindowWithAlphaTcl), and

 #  
 #  One important side-effect of this procedure is that if the window is
 #  a file which exists on disk, and if the modification time can be
 #  read, then this function will always store the modification time as
 #  an alphatcl-window attribute.  This, together with the fact that on
 #  saving AlphaTcl also sets/updates the modified attribute, means that
 #  other code can assume that if the modified attribute exists for a
 #  window, it is equivalent to the fact that the window is associated
 #  with a file that Alpha ought to be able to manipulate.
 #  
 #  Note: we should probably make 'forceMainScreen' a package and remove
 #  it from here.  However -- it's clear there may be conficts between
 #  such a change and the idea that some other openHook (inst mode, say)
 #  may also wish to change window position (in Inst mode's case to move
 #  the window a long-way offscreen).  This would impose a sequence
 #  dependence we need to resolve.
 #  
 #  Strictly speaking, since this can be called whether or not the
 #  given window is frontmost, each mode's <mode>::MarkFile should
 #  also be happy with both cases (which means its mode variables may
 #  not have been copied to global).

 # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # 
 # "alpha::changeMode" --
 # 
 #  A very important procedure which is private to this file.  It
 #  handles all switching from one mode to another.  This is _not_ a
 #  procedure which should be called by packages/extensions or indeed
 #  any other part of AlphaTclCore.  To change the mode associated with
 #  the current window, call win::ChangeMode.
 #  
 #  What does it mean to change mode?  Modes store variables in a
 #  <mode>modeVars array, and have certain packages (menus/features)
 #  associated with them.  Also floating windows can be mode-specific.
 #  
 #  So, what we do is first is call a 'changeModeFrom' hook to let
 #  any code know that a given mode is being switched out.
 #  
 #  Second, we get rid of the last mode, which involves removing any
 #  lastmode-specific floating windows, restoring or removing any global
 #  variables set from <lastmode>modeVars, and deactivating any features
 #  which will no longer be required for the new mode (we calculate a
 #  difference-list so we never deactivate a feature only to activate it
 #  a few lines of code later).
 #  
 #  Third we load the new mode (call its init script which usually means
 #  we source its main file), the result of which is that we must have
 #  evaluated all 'newPref' commands (strictly speaking it is ok to
 #  call newPref later as well, but that's not good practice).
 #  
 #  Finally we call any newmode-init script (and any mode-init hooks) if
 #  this is the first time the mode is loaded, then we copy over
 #  <newmode>modeVars (remembering any global vars which are shadowed),
 #  activate all new features, show any newmode-specific floating menus.
 #  If it's the first time the mode is loaded, we'll source the user's
 #  <newmode>Prefs.tcl and lastly call 'changeMode' hooks.
 #  
 #  The first argument must _always_ be a real mode.  The second
 #  optional argument is a list of featuremodes which are associated
 #  with the current window (typically just a list with one element -
 #  the same as the first argument).
 #  
 #  AlphaTcl stores the last mode ($::mode) and last set of extra
 #  feature-modes ($::featureModes) and compares those with the new
 #  values.  These two sets of information are then used to determine
 #  whether (a) the global mode needs changing, and (b) whether the
 #  feature-modes have changed.  In either case we must then determine
 #  the set of packages/features which need to be activated and
 #  deactivated to complete the change.

 # "contextualMenuHook" --
 # 
 # Calls any item registered with
 # 
 # hook::register contextualMenuHook <procName>
 # 
 # and passes it along.  The value for '$pos' is determined by the core. 
 # Also creates an "alpha::CMArgs" variable which contains a four item list
 # of the CM click position, start and end positions of selection including
 # CM click position, and the selectionDesc.
 # 
 # If there is no selection, or if the selection doesn't include the CM
 # click position, all three positions are the same.  (Any CM menu item can
 # still check to see if there's a selection if desired using
 # 'isSelection'.)
 # 
 # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # 
 # What's up with '$selectionDesc' ??
 # 
 # $selectionDesc is an identifier that, when passed to TclAE routines,
 # gives you access to the AppleEvent internals:
 # 
 # «Alpha8» tclAE::createDesc null
 # tclAEDesc.3
 # «Alpha8» tclAE::print tclAEDesc.3
 # 'null'()
 # «Alpha8» tclAE::getData tclAEDesc.3
 # «Alpha8» tclAE::getDescType tclAEDesc.3
 # null
 # «Alpha8» tclAE::disposeDesc tclAEDesc.3
 # «Alpha8» tclAE::getData tclAEDesc.3
 # Error: Couldn't find "tclAEDesc.3": OSErr -1701, errAEDescNotFound
 # 
 # In this case, this is a null AppleEvent descriptor; i.e., it contains
 # no data at this point.  The idea is that if your CM handlers decide
 # that the context (as initially defined by the positions) has some
 # more abstract representation, they stuff what they like into
 # $selectionDesc.  Once all Alpha's CM handlers are done putting
 # whatever they like into $selectionDesc, it gets returned to the CMM
 # to pass on to any external CMM handlers (like FinderPop) to process
 # as they see fit (generally by calling back to Alpha and asking for
 # the descriptor to be resolved to a piece of text).

 # "dndWinHook" --
 # 
 #  Called when attempting to drag/drop anything into an Alphatk/8/X window
 #  
 #  Should return either a string with the kind of action that will be
 #  taken (can also use status::msg to pass on more info to the user),
 #  if the drag of the given data/item(s) is allowed in the given window
 #  at the given position, or "none" if the action is not allowed,
 #  Should not throw an error on good input.
 #  
 #  'options' is a list of name-value pairs (i.e. a Tcl dictionary).
 #  Currently supported entries are:
 #  
 #   'type' (the type/flavour of the item(s) being dragged)
 #   'data' (which typically contains a _list_ of filenames)
 #   'pos' (which is the window position of the drag event)
 #   'actions' (the possible actions - a list of copy, link, move, none)
 #   'action' (the recommended or current action)
 #   'modifiers' (a Tcl list of "Control", "Option", "Shift", etc - whatever 
 #   is held down by the user when the hook is called).
 #   
 #  On some platforms the data element may not always be available to us
 #  until the actual drop takes place (before that we can only know the
 #  type of item being dropped).  In such cases the 'data' element will
 #  be the empty string, and we will just have to do our best!
 #  Currently on Windows data is always provided, and on X11 it is not.
 #  
 #  As well as calling this hook, Alphatk makes sure that the window is
 #  visually updated to reflect the forthcoming drag/drap (with
 #  appropriate highlights and an insertion-position indication).  These
 #  will be removed on leave/drop events, and will be applied on
 #  enter/drag events (the latter will happen only if this routine
 #  returns a valid action).
 #  
 #  This procedure will call any of three AlphaTcl hooks (which may be
 #  used by other AlphaTcl packages to interact with drag/drop
 #  operations):
 #  
 #  dndEnter $win $options
 #  - Return a valid action if the hook wants to take over this
 #  operation for this window (possibly "none" if the hook wants to
 #  reject the drop), otherwise throw an error.
 #  
 #  dndDrag $win $options
 #  - I imagine not many hooks will want this.  It can be used to
 #  allow dropping only into one part of a window, for example.
 #  It is called repeatedly as the mouse moves in the window.
 #  
 #  dndDrop $win $options
 #  - Carry out the drop and return a valid action (typically "move" or
 #  "copy" -- you can just return [dict get $options action] if you
 #  don't care), or return "none" to abort the drop.
 #  
 #  To Do 1: see how this works with possible hooks in practice.
 #  
 #  To Do 2: how can we register a hook which only fires for certain 
 #  drag types?  Or must each hook check the type and only take action
 #  for the types it wants?
