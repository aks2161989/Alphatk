#   af        01.09.95    Initialization for new Alpha >= 6.01 fixed
#                         All module templates fixed to behave usefully
#   af        10.06.96    Fixed a few Modula-2 tcl bugs (see SysEcol
#                         bug list)
#   af        24.06.96    Fixed a indentation and mark file bugs (see SysEcol
#                         bug list)
#   af        28.06.96    Wrap bug fixed and new configuration added to better
#                         support new features, e.g. defineFileSaveFormat
#   af        13.09.96    Fixed a bug when "ErrList.DOK" wasn't found
#                         during start-up
#   af        17.09.96    Fixes for the Alpha-bug with the prefs.tcl
#                         execution (twice, instead of just once)
#                         Testing this script while using Alpha 6.5
#   af        30.12.96    M2MarkFile bug fixed to properly deal with
#                         procIdent ::= char {char | digit }
#                         (jt's version was: procIdent ::= {char} )
#   af        06.03.97    Attempt to improve the nasty, confusing behavior
#                         of wrapComment by giving the user better hints,
#                         however, without being able to really fix the problem
#   af        26.05.97    Template menu did no longer work for unknwon reasons
#                         proc dispatchSubMenuCmds added. Template menu offers
#                         now more all template items
#   af        05.06.97    askForModuleName improved for editing of names
#   af        21.09.97    Improving error messages of launching
#   af        16.09.97    setLnBreakBehavior added which sets now (finally,
#                         sic!) Alpha's global fillColumn, wrapLow, and
#                         wrapHigh variables to avoid annoying line breaks
#                         during programming of long lines.

#                         open if working file(s) couldn't be opened
#                         Final version having all (even for long outstanding
#                         issues) resolved.
#                         Note configuration uses its own variables, since those
#                         mechanisms were introduced long before Alpha offered
#                         its newPref feature.  Since this script ought to work
#                         also with pre 7 Alphas, this a bit complex
#                         implementation technique is (not yet?) abandoned
#   af        08.02.98    Finalizing M2 mode for release 3.0
#   af        09.02.98    Adding contributions from Tom Fetherston (

#                         M2::insertDivider. Thanks!

#                         Thanks!
#   af        11.02.98    Changing behavior of RET. Does now break line and
#                         SHIFT-RET jumps out of line.
#   af        13.02.98    Adding bug fixes by Tom Fetherston for M2::parseFuncs
#                         and new M2::MarkFile, which does now also recognize
#                         modules. Release 3.0 completed.
#   af        17.02.98    V 3.0.1 fixing rshift, lshift menu bug

#                         specific) behavior of jumpToTemplatePlaceHolder
#                         and M2:carriageReturn
#   af        03.03.98    V 3.0.5 Minor improvements in self-documentation of
#                         newPref vars and a bit of cleaning up, i.e. removing,
#                         of stuff gone obsolete with latest Alpha 7.1b2
#                         openOtherLibModule and section marks added

#                         minimizes now surrounding white space to single blank
#    af       30.03.98    V 3.1b4 Complete revision of M2::MarkFile for new
#                         prefs and fixing bugs in appearance of M-button lists;
#                         Making commentSelection and uncommentSelection behave
#                         more robustly.  Ctrl^c and Ctrl^Shift^c for simple
#                         commenting (uses prefix/suffixString) added.
#                         doM2ShiftLeft/Right selects now line if no selection.
#                         killWholeLine removes now also empty line

#    af       09.04.98    V 3.1.1 menu/Menu bug fixed removed again, since Vince
#                         fixed it in Alpha 7.1b6. However, new version checking
#                         added, especially also in OPEN-TO-INSTALL to ensure
#                         user is well informed about compatibility of M2 mode
#                         with certain Alpha versions
#    af       15.04.98    V 3.1.2 Cmd^Cntrl^doubleclik finds now also marks in
#                         any definition module residing within same folder
#    af       17.04.98    New key bindings:

#                         - skipPrevLnOpenNew         (skipPrevLnOpenNew dropped)
# 
#                         Cmd^Ctrl^Shift^Return       - skipLnReturn
#    af       20.04.98    M2::DblClickHelper buggy bevavior fixed, skips search in
#                         currently open files if Ctrl^Cmd^Click and search does
#                         in currently open files succeeds only if match exact
#    af       07.05.98    V 3.1.3 Using Juan Fualgeras better completions
#                         Recognizes extension DTF
#    af       12.05.98    V 3.1.4 Searches also in RAMSES Sys DEFs
#                         - removing configureM2Mode from M2 menu if Alpha is 7.x
#                         solution to Juan's suggestion of avoiding use of a trace
#                         which slows down entering of M2 mode.
#    af       13.07.98    Testing phase for V 3.1.4 with Alpha 7.1fc1, 7.1fc2, and
#                         7.1fc3 over => Mode is fit for release
#    af       15.07.98    V 3.1.4 released
#    af       27.08.98    Testing phase for V 3.1.5 with Alpha 7.1fc6, 7.1prerelease
#    af       30.08.98    Adding openFileQuietly replacement by Jonathan Guyer
#    af       30.10.98    V 3.1.6  Fixed bugs in adjCurLnToIndentAbove and
#                         adjCurLnToIndentBelow; showFullName added
#    af       08.12.98    V 3.1.7  Adjustments made for Alpha 7.1p4, i.e. use now
#                         Menu instead of menu if Alpha V >= 7
#    af       01.03.99    V 3.2.0 Finds now also modules if cmd-clicking module name
#                         - bug fixed with finding always marks in currently open
#                           windows
#    af       17.03.99    - M2::MarkFile does now permanently save marks, even if
#                           file was opened as read-only. Useful when
#                           ctrl^cmd^double-clicking names of procedures or modules.
#                         - Double-clicking module names, e.g. in import lists, does
#                           jump to either the corresponding quick reference section
#                           or the definition module as suggested by Juan Falgueras.
#                         - Fixed bug with autoconfiguration in case of a corrupted
#                           desktop or otherwise bad or missing MacMETH or RAMSES
#                           installation. User is now notified. Important, since
#                           lots of mode's function are likely to fail if the
#                           autoconfiguration fails, e.g. cmd^double-click, and user
#                           may not understand at all why.
#    af       22.03.99    V 3.2.1 Colorizing of UNTIL added
#    af       24.03.99    V 3.2.2 intelCutPaste flag turned off
#    af       08.04.99    Minor modifications in section determining version, which
#                         have no effect on the mode
#    af       24.03.99    V 3.2.3 fixing quick reference problem (case sensitivity)
#    af       14.04.99    V 3.2.4 intelCutPaste renamed to smartCutPaste
#                         - M2::correctIndentation fixed to perform according to
#                           specs to support smartPaste feature.
#                         - getIndentation fixed to expand tabs (which are inserted
#                           against all rules by some routines, e.g. by smartPaste
#                           despite there is a routine M2:indentLine, which does
#                           NOT insert a horizontal tab
#                         - doM2ShiftLeft and doM2ShiftRight expand now tabs before
#                           shifting to avoid unsuccessful shift in case there
#                           should be tabs present in the involved line(s)
#                         - prefs indentUsingSpacesOnly now set
#    af       22.04.99    V 3.2.5 attempt to fix some installation problems if
#                         installed from scratch on a machine without a RAMSES shell
#                         - openWorkFiles renamed to M2::openWorkFiles (since it
#                           uses a global binding)
#                         - installDebugFlag and various message production inserted
#                           for easier debugging in case of installation problems
#                         - reportOnShellLaunchFail improved
#                         - copyRing is no longer by default active (slows mode
#                           entering down and is currently rather unstable)
#    af       17.05.99    V 3.2.6 EXPORT added to reserved words
#                         - Uses now a menu icon (ID = 145) to avoid bug of Alpha
#    af       23.05.99    V 3.3b0 complete overhaul to split mode in several files

#                         no problem.
#                         - distinguishing now wether Alpha is really 7.2, since
#                           only the latter contains the new blue M2 menu resource

#                         - m2Mode.tcl was never really sourced because startup hook
#                           was not really installed. => opening of work object
#                           failed when launching Alpha e.g. via RAMSES shell. Now

#                           Mode is no longer upward compatible with Alpha versions
#                           earlier than 7.5
#                         - any addDef call replaced by prefs::modified

#    cbu      05.09.02    V 3.8
#                         - All procs now in 'M2' namespace
#                         - When mode is first sourced, user is given the option
#                           to make bindings global.
#    af       23.02.03    V 3.8.1
#                         - Fixing web site under maintainer
#                         - Merging with independently developed version Craig B Upright
#                           has made
#                         - wordWrap (later lineWrap) is now supported as
#                           mode specific preference (by default off) but
#                           it does not work
#                         - smartPaste is now supported as mode specific preference (by default off,
#                           since it fails to work properly)
#                         - M2::showFullName bindings are global, now treated together
#                           with the other global bindings 
#                         - M2::unsetGlobalBindings (m2Mode.tcl) called conditionally
#                         - M2::fromWhichDir from m2GlobAux.tcl default dir set to
#                           Work dir within M2ShellHome
#                         - M2::expandWords includes now many more of the Modula-2
#                           reserved words such as SET, DIV, MOD etc. (m2Syntax.tcl)
#                         - Same is true for M2::standardProcs. which
#                           includes FLOATD LONG MIN MAX (m2Syntax.tcl)
#                         - MacMETH specific reserved words or standard procedures
#                           are added in separate lines (m2Syntax.tcl)
#                         - newPref variable standardProcColor green and little
#                           used libColor blue 
#                         - templateDEFINITION renamed to M2::templateDEFINITION (m2Templates.tcl)
#                         - 2nd variant of completions made the final one (1st discarded)
#                         - electricSemicolon now M2 pref to turn it off by default
#                         - M2::expandSpace now also bound to standard Ctrl^TAB (and F1) instead
#                           of Cmd^TAB only (expansions should now again be accessible in OS X)
#                         - same for M2::completePrevWord, but this causes a conflict with
#                           previous real TAB insertion (Ctrl^Opt^TAB)
#                         - Real TAB insertion now bound to even less accessible 
#                           (Ctrl^Opt^Cmd^TAB), which is quite good so, since this feature
#                           is there only for "emergency cases"
#                         - M2::expandSpace now also bound to new more convenient
#                           alternatives, notably on PowerBook keyboards: Numkeypad-1 and ESC 
#                         - new preference electricNumKeypad_1 allows to control electric feature
#                           of Numkeypad-1
#                         - All binding management from m2AdjPrefs.tcl moved to m2Bindings.tcl
#                           => introduced procs M2::activateSpaceBarExpansion,
#                           M2::deactivateSpaceBarExpansion, M2::activateElectricNumKeypad1,
#                           and M2::deactivateElectricNumKeypad1
#                         - improving uninstallation, which did not work reliably
#                           anymore under Alpha 7.6. However, it appears not to be
#                           possible to really remove everything properly. E.g. there
#                           remains a hidden CVS folder inside the "$HOME:Tcl:Modes:M2 Mode:" 
#                           folder.
#                         - fixed procs M2::wrapComment and M2::wrapText from m2Edit.tcl
#                           They failed miserably due to changes in the underlying Alpha
#                           commands routines.
#                         - improved the behavior of above 2 procs by testing for meaningful
#                           parameters. Avoids touching the text if M2_FillRightMargin <=
#                           leftMargColumn and informs user about problem.
#                           
#                           REMAINING ISSUE(s): Global bindings issue not resolved, since
#                           V 3.8.1 does now initially ask user for activation of
#                           the global bindings. This behavior is quite convenient
#                           and should not interfere with any Alpha users never
#                           activating the mode. However, the proposed feature
#                           solution (globalM2Bindings 1.0) forming part of the 
#                           Alpha 7.6 release is an alternative, which looks even 
#                           better.  Yet, I would prefer to have an activation mechanism
# 			    of this feature available for first time users, which is
# 			    of a similar convenience as the existing implementation.  
# 			    
#    af       26.02.03    V 3.8.2
#                         - Deinstallation sequence modified (prefs deleted only at end)
#                         - However, deinstallation should no longer be attempted
#                           since Alpha 7.6 does not like this at all => warning added
#                         - globalM2Bindings.tcl integrated as additional feature
#                           "alpha::feature globalM2Bindings 1.0" to control global 
#                           bindings anytime. User is only asked about this global
#                           feature (yet implementation would allow to control the
#                           behavior merely from within the M2 mode; cheap 
#                           implementation, yet the behavior is conceptually only
#                           as if a global feature is used.
#                         - newPref flag globalOpenBindings statement moved from
#                           alpha::mode M2 3.8.2 {... to m2Prefs.tcl 
#                         - All code involved in the interaction between M2 mode
#                           and globalM2Bindings.tcl made safe, so that the
#                           dependence of globalM2Bindings.tcl on M2 mode is
#                           properly checked first before doing anything. 
#                           Otherwise warning messages.
#                         - fixing of all prefs assignments done which were
#                           assigned explicitely before newPref statements. E.g.
#                           M2WrapRightMargin was assigned two blanks instead of 65
#                           if M2modeVars(m2_fillRightMargin) didn't yet exist
#                         - global pref indentUsingSpacesOnly made a mode requirement
#                           since M2 specific setting never got recognized and 
#                           outcommented in m2Prefs.tcl, since it showed up
#                           in prefs dialog (F12) twice. Bug in Alpha 7.6?
#                         - M2::showFullName now available only in M2 mode
#                         - m2Prefs.tcl and m2Config.tcl assign m2_shellName,
#                           m2_errListDOK etc. with [file join
#                         - M2::adjustGlobalOpenBindings in m2AdjPrefs.tcl
#                           does now call package::activate "globalM2Bindings"
#                           or package::deactivate "globalM2Bindings"
#                         - Same for m2Bindings.tcl
#                         - No more binding done in alpha::mode activation
#                           script
#                         - M2::setGlobalBindings in m2Bindings.tcl made
#                           more effective (ensures M2 specific bindings)
#                         - M2::makeOnOrOff from Vince used to make status
#                           of global feature "globalM2Bindings" consistent
#                           with possible changes of pref 
#                           M2modeVars(globalOpenBindings). This new

#                           really help
#    af       28.03.03    V 3.8.5
#                         - Added all changes made and committed to cvs by
#                           Vince Darley (m2Marking.tcl, m2ShellUse.tcl)
#    af       29.03.03    V 3.8.6
#                         - Added one more change in m2Marking.tcl
#    af       12.04.03    V 3.8.7
#                         - unixMode case fix by Vince Darley
#                         - broken templates fixed by conditional calls to
#                           tabsToSpaces in m2Edit.tcl
#                         - broken previousLine (in Alpha8 8.0b8) circumvented
#                           in M2::getIndentation in m2Edit.tcl by using 
#                           prevLineSelect to fix endless loop (was pretty nasty 
#                           bug, which crashed the entire system regularly)
#    af       30.04.03    V 3.8.8
#                         - elecCompletions removed (by Vince Darley - v1.11 -> 1.12)
#    af       18.05.03    V 3.8.9
#                         - calling tclAE::installEventHandler instead of eventHandler
#                           in m2ShellUse.tcl if Alpha >= 8 (however, does not work)
#                           To support Alpha 7.6 I still use eventHandler (the only
#                           technqiue which seems to work in Alpha8 8.0b8
#                         - global prefs (in m2Prefs.tcl) handled in more general way
#                           to support Alpha 7.6 again (Vince's changes made the mode
#                           to be partly broken under 7.6)
#                         - M2Completions.tcl and m2Marking.tcl was broke under 7.6 due to 
#                           lsort -dictionary. Made this conditional for >= 8.0 only.
#                         - Explicit deinstallation of entire mode, since Alpha's
#                           core no longer supports any deinstallation (uninstall
#                           is of course an ugly action, but obviously wanted by 
#                           some users)
#                         - globalM2Bindings v1.1: Improved activation and deinstallation
#                           Works now for any combination of deinstallation or installation
#                           of mode M2 and global feature  globalM2Bindings
#                         - Fixing in m2Config.tcl file name assignment for err.ALPHA
#                           and token.ALPHA
#                         - Tried out M2::dummyHandler approach as suggested by Craig
#                           Upright in an attempt to fix opening of work files via
#                           Apple Events (oM2f,comp) without needing to load/launch
#                           M2 mode once per Alpha session. Did not help, but did not
#                           hurt either
#                         - Fixed opening of work files for AlphaX vs Alpha8 (Classic)
#                           by adding proc mac2unix (from FrŽdŽric Boulanger) into 
#                           m2GlobAux.tcl and altering opening algos accordingly in 
# 			    M2::openM2WorkFiles from m2CompErr.tcl
#                         - Moved proc M2::makeOnOrOff from m2Bindings.tcl to 
#                           m2BackCompatibility.tcl
#                         - In proc M2::DblClick forced M2 mode by win::ChangeMode M2
#                           to overcome effect of bug #933 in Alpha8/X
#                         - Fixing broken M2::openOtherLibModule from m2Utils.tcl in 
#                           Alpha8/X: In Alpha 7.6 a construction like set path 
#                           "[file join $path ""] results in a path separator at end.  
#                           None is added in Alpha8/X. In procs M2::otherLibModule
#                           statements added ot  assign variable pathSep 
#                           which makes the code portable among all current AlphaTcl 
#                           versions. 
#                         - Reversed use of M2::dummyHandler, since events were not
#                           reliable passed on for all Alpha versions (7.6 8 X)
#                         - m2BackCompatibilty.tcl belongs now to kernel of M2 mode and 
#                           is loaded always by m2Load.tcl to ensure accessibility of 
#                           proc M2::makeOnOrOff (for package::makeOnOrOff available
#                           only in Alpha 8/X)
#                         - Including Vince's changes to m2Mode.tcl (v1.12 -> v1.13)
#                         - Including Vince's changes to Modula-2 Help (v1.7 -> v1.8)
#                         - Source should now be fully CVS controlled
#                         - Testing of mode in OS 9.2.2, Classic, and OS X 10.2.6 using 
#                           Alpha 7.6, Alpha8 8.0b8, and AlphaX 8.0b8. All known bugs 
#                           removed. Seems to work in all combinations of OS and Alpha.
#                         - Final cleanup for release of this mode (commitment)
#    af       25.06.03    V 3.9.0
#                         - electricReturn removed and newPref flag indentOnReturn
#                           added (see CVS modification by Vince Darley - v1.14 -> 1.15)
#                         - Fixing a bug in m2CompErr.tcl where M2::openWorkFiles failed 
#                           with a relative path in fileToEditName which attempted to 
#                           access a file outside the shell's directory.
#                         - Improved error message display for M2::openWorkFiles
#    af       12.07.03    V 3.9.1
#                         - Explanations by Craig Upright for pref indentOnReturn 
#                           added (see CVS modification by Craig Upright 
#                           (see "mode electric prefs balloon/help text" 
#                           m2Mode.tcl - v1.15 -> v1.16) and m2Prefs.tcl - 1.7 and 1.8)
#                         - Ignoring latest change made by Vince Darley (see CVS 
#                           modification of m2Prefs.tcl - v1.8 -> 1.9), since he
#                           obviously overlooked that the purpose of the newPref flag
#                           elecCompletions is only for support of Alpha 7.6.
#                         - m2Load.tcl - v1.4 -> v1.5 by Vince
#    af       22.08.03    V 3.9.2

#                         - globalM2bindings.tcl offers now description
#                           (Craig Upright v1.3 -> v1.4)
#                         - m2Config.tcl using prompt instead of getline
#                           (Craig Upright v1.5 -> v1.6)

#                         - m2Prefs.tcl converted wordWrap (later lineWrap)
#                           to variable pref and added Help button to new
#                           prefs dialogs
#                           (Vince Darley v1.13 -> 1.14 -> 1.15)

#    af       24.09.04    V 4.0.2
#                         - proc M2::adjustGlobalOpenBindings in 
#                           m2AdjPrefs.tcl uses now package::makeOnOrOff
#                           instead of the defunct M2::makeOnOrOff. This
#                           fixes the bug with M2 preference settings (F12)
#                           for pref "GlobalOpenBindings" (Ctrl-0, -1,
#                           and Ctrl-2)

#                           
#                           This allows to have the following few
#                           statements in the M2Prefs.tcl file:
#

#                           procedure declarations in DEFINITION modules
#                         - Dialog for local modules no longer asks for 
#                           ident of program module
#                         - Local modules may have an ident longer than 12
#                           chars
#                         - Local module generation results in proper 
#                           placing of cursor after insertion
#                         - Expansion of reserved word DEFINITION results
#                           in proper placing of cursor after insertion
#                         - New binding (Ctrl-Shift-J) as reverse of 
#                           Ctrl-Shift). It splits a line at the current 
#                           position and indents second part in a M2
#                           syntax specific way (BTW Ctrl-J joins).
#                         - M2::jumpToTemplatePlaceHolder improved so
#                           that it is possible to break current line
#                           if cursor is exactly before an END or ELSE
#                           (value 4 returned to indicate unindent)
#                           This measure improves behavior to RETURN 
#                           considerably.
#    af       24.06.05    V 4.2
#                         - Bug fix: M2::findNextError failed for multiple 
#                           files containing errors to switch windows
#                         - Introducing M2::getM2ErrMsg in m2CompErr.tcl
#                           to support improved behavior of M2::findNextError
#                           in case user has closed a file currently
#                           contained in m2ErrRing
#                         - M2::convertErrLstToErrALPHA introduced to
#                           create M2_err.ALPHA from a possibly present
#                           M2_err.LST. Note, the RAMSES shell deletes the
#                           err.LST from the M2ShellHome.  First parameter from
#                           AppleScript (osascript generated by sh function
#                           openM2WorkFiles) passed to M2::EventHandlerAlpha8
#                           can be used to distinguish whether to call
#                           M2::convertErrLstToErrALPHA or not.  The file
#                           M2_err.ALPHA is written in a format, which lists
#                           errors per row and column instead of the absolute
#                           file positions as in err.ALPHA.
#                         - Introduced preferences openP1WorkFiles and
#                           m2_P1AuxFileCacheFolder. Flag openP1WorkFiles
#                           indicates how proc M2::openM2WorkFiles should
#                           call M2::openM2WorkFiles.
#                         - M2::EventHandlerAlpha8 maintains new 
#                           preference flag openP1WorkFiles to indicate to
#                           M2::openM2WorkFiles in which mode to operate, so the
#                           M2 mode can distinguish whether it is called via the
#                           RAMSES shell (MacMETH compiler, p1InUse = FALSE) or
#                           RASS-OSX utilities 'mk' and 'mk1'.  Since flag
#                           openP1WorkFiles indicates how proc
#                           M2::openM2WorkFiles should call M2::openM2WorkFiles,
#                           this means that last call of AlphaX via a shell
#                           determines how the next menu command "M2 -> Open
#                           Work Files" (CTRL-0) should operate. You can anytime
#                           override what M2::EventHandlerAlpha8 by using the
#                           standard preference dialog of the M2 mode.
#                         - p1InUse = TRUE (see procs M2::openWorkFiles and 
#                           M2::openM2WorkFiles) requires the presence of
#                           M2_ErrListP1.DOK as well as M2_err.LST in
#                           folder as given by pref m2_P1AuxFileCacheFolder
#                         - Thanks to all changes described above, proc 
#                           M2::openM2WorkFiles fully supports now the marking
#                           and display of errors either for MacMETH compiler or
#                           the P1 compiler (behavior depends on actual
#                           parameter value p1InUse as determined by M2 pref
#                           openP1WorkFiles)
#                         - proc M2::curUsersHome (m2GlobAux.tcl) introduced
#                         - Bug fix: proc M2::removeAllM2ErrMarks (m2CompErr.tcl) 
#                           no longer affects windows (e.g. belonging even to
#                           another mode) which are not listed in m2ErrRing
