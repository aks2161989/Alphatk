================================================================================

The "Mail Menu" is an extension package for AlphaTcl that allows e-mails to be
composed in Alpha and sent via several different "mail handler" services.

= To Do List
================================================================================

• Take the folders (those not ending in " Folder") from the Eudora Folder
  (recursively) to build the list of current MailBoxes, i.e. don't ask for them
  from Eudora via AE.

Note: I (Craig) am unlikely to do anything more with the Eudora Mail Handler.
I'll continue to make minor improvements as they relate to the main Mail Menu
and other handlers, but I don't intend any new features and really don't want to
be responsible for fixing things that I didn't break.  (i.e. bug# 1142.)

• Make use of Joachim's "console" package, now in AlphaTcl SystemCode.

= Version History
================================================================================

(slightly abridged for versions earlier than 1.0)

Changes include those for Mail Mode, Mail Menu, and all of the Mail Handler
packages that are included in the standard distribution.

================================================================================
= 2.0 released                             last update: 01/09/2006 {02:14:38 PM}
================================================================================

• Mail Menu v 2.0
• Code appears stable enough to consider "final".

================================================================================
= 2.0fc3 released                          last update: 04/06/2005 {11:18:47 AM}
================================================================================

• Mail Menu v 2.0b1
• Split "mailMenu.tcl" into several different files:
  "Changes - Mail Menu"
  "mailEudora.tcl"
  "mailMenu.tcl"
  "mailMode.tcl"
  "mailParsing.tcl"
  "mailSystem.tcl"
  "mailTcllib.tcl"
  "mailWindows.tcl"
• Each "mail handler" service is defined in an [alpha::library] package, and
  defines a "Mail::<handler>" namespace.
• Revived [Mail::handlerChanged] procedure.
• Each service defines a [Mail::<handler>::handlerChanged] procedure which takes
  a boolean value.  When the "mailHandler" is changed we first undo any action
  taken by the previous handler, unset the "menu::additions(mailMenu)" array
  item so that we start with a clean slate, and then register any hooks, add new
  preferences and menu items for the new handler.
• [Mail::handleAction] now checks to see if the namespace proc has been defined.
• The default "Mail Menu > Reply (To All)" menu shortcut has been changed to
  "Shift-Command-R" and uses a dynamic preference name: "reply/ReplyToAll". 
  Since Eudora is only available in MacOS we know that the pair is dynamic.
• The default "Mail Menu > Send" shortcut is now "Shift-Command-S".
• New "Mail Menu > Mail Menu Help" submenu, with [Mail::handlerHelp] procedure
  and support in [alpha::library] files.
• Mail Menu v 2.0b2
• New "rememberRecipientEmail" preference will automatically adjust the list of
  addresses in the "Mail Menu > New Message To" menu.
• The "Mail Menu > New Message To" menu now allows the user to specify an actual
  item name for the menu, not just the e-mail address that is used.
• Changed some of the Tcl-lib server preference names to make it clear that
  these are for the SMTP server.  They are now listed in the Mail Mode Prefs
  dialog in the "Server Information" pane.
• Changed the name of the "Tcl - smtp" Mail Handler to "Alpha" to make it less
  intimidating for users.
• Mail Menu v 2.0b3
• Added new "Alpha" Mail Handler capabilities to download messages from the
  Inbox of a remote server for browsing/viewing, using Tcl-lib "pop3" package.
  Downloaded message can also be deleted from the server.
• If the server accepts [::pop3::top] calls, then we don't download the entire
  message contents in [Mail::tcllib::openMailbox], just the headers.  In this
  case we must download the entire message in [Mail::goToMatch].
• Removed the [Mail::killMailboxWindow] procedure -- we now attempt to replace
  any current "* MAILBOX '$folder'" window with new contents.
• New "mailbrowse" minor-mode for MAILBOX windows.  These have the same bindings
  as "Brws" windows, plus those of Mail mode, with the Mail menu but no colors.
• New "Mail > Forward" command.
• Fancier "On <date>, <from> wrote:" in Reply To e-mail window bodies.
• Better error handling in [Mail::tcllib::QueueToSend] to inform the user if and
  why a message was not sent to a particular recipient.
• New preference to only ask for password information once.
• New [Mail::tcllib::closeHook] to explicitly close the socket channel when the
  Inbox window has been killed.  This should help ensure that trashed messages
  are properly deleted from the server.
• The "Start/Stop Notifying" routines have been removed from the "Tell Eudora"
  menu.  The code has been archived, but there are no plans to revive it.
• Better handling of the open socket channel in the Alpha handler, with a new
  [Mail::tcllib::closeSocket] procedure.
• Multiple account "identities" are supported in the Alpha handler.
• Better password management in the Alpha handler, never saved between editing 
  sessions but always saved during the current one.
• Alpha handler creates "File > New > New E-mail Inbox" menu item.
• Menu build procs are defined (and the [menu::buildSome] is called) when Mail 
  mode is sourced, in [Mail::initializeMode].
• Minor display changes for View Mail windows.
• Common menu preferences are defined in "mailMode.tcl".
• Mail Menu v 2.0b4
• Minor menu re-organization.
• [Mail::createFromWindow] now takes an "args" list which is turned into an
  array to determine proper field names and values.
• New "MAIL" windows replace any earlier ones.  We might relax this in the
  future, perhaps to give each window a unique title that contains a portion of
  the "Subject:" line.
• New [Mail::colorizeMailWindow] procedure takes care of colorizing header
  fields and creating hyperlinks.  We now hyperlink all urls and "mailto:" links
  that appear in the window.
• New "mailview" minor-mode which doesn't have any default colors.  This gives
  us greater control over what we color (and what we don't) without running into
  long-standing Alpha8/X core issues where [text::color] and [regModeKeywords]
  don't play well together.  (The main issue here is the conflict with the
  [regModeKeywords] "-c" flag for coloring comments that appears to confuse
  ending color breaks.)
• New "Mail Menu > View Full Header" command for the Alpha handler.  (Useful for
  debugging this package!)
• [Mail::createFromWindow] will attempt to parse html formatted text.
• New Mail mode "Electric Semicolon" will allow ";" to toggle amongst MAILBOX
  and MAIL windows.  (Currently hard-wired using [Bind] -- need to figure out
  how to make this work with minor modes.)
• New "renderHtmlFormattedText" preference.
• New "alwaysBccTo" preference.
• New [Mail::getFieldValue] procedure to simplify replying/forwarding.
• Separate beg/endIndex values for each pop3Server Inbox. (Multiple Identities.)
• New preferences for mail window geometry.  If "rememberWindowGeometry" is
  turned on, any re-sizing will reset the default browse/view window parameters.
• Support for "Reply-To:" fields; used in [Mail::replyToEmail] (finally.)
• [Mail::createEmailWindow] now accepts an arbitrary number of header fields in
  an "args" list rather than a pre-ordered set.
• First support for Quoted-Printable Content-Transfer-Encoding.
• [Mail::createFromWindow] renamed to [Mail::createViewWindow].
• Moved some general Mail Window utility procedures to "mailMode.tcl".
• New [Mail::parseContents] procedure handles the manipulation of the "contents"
  text string, including the translation of "quoted-printable" elements and the
  rendering of any html formatted text.
• Mail Menu v 2.0b5
• Moved all parsing/colorizing procedures for view windows to "mailParsing.tcl".
• Better handling of multi-part mime contents, using [Mail::parseContents]
  helper procedures.  Attachments are presented as a one-line statement, but are
  no longer included in the message.  See [Mail::parseExtra].
• Support for the mime content-type "multipart/digest" in [Mail::parseMulti].
• User control over default font/fontsize in Mail viewing windows.
• Support for "Mail Menu > Prev/Next Message" commands.  At present we have to
  explicitly bring the Mailbox browsing window to the front to do this.
• The default Mail Handler is now "Alpha".
• All default shortcuts now use "Shift-Control" as default modifiers.
• [Mail::requireMailWindow] now uses "viewer" argument instead of "from".
• New [Mail::OptionTitlebar] procedure lists all current Mail mode windows.
• New [Mail::MarkFile] procedure, based on the window type.
• New "autoFloatMailboxWindowMarks" for Mailbox windows.
• New "colorNewMailQuotedText" pref toggles comment colors in New Mail windows.
• The "Mail Windows" pref pane is now hidden by default.  It is up to each Mail
  Handler to make it visible if browsing/viewing windows are supported.
• [Mail::colorizeWindow] attempts to color/hyper html formatted text.
• Updated "quoted-printable" character set.
• [Mail::tcllib::viewFullHeader] adds divider line.
• The default Mail Handler has been changed back to "OS Mailer".  This handler
  is the most basic, with no menu changes, and cannot be uninstalled by the
  user.  An explicit change to "Alpha" also saves the handler preference so that
  during startup the "File > New > Open Inbox" item will be presented.
• ":" is no longer recognized as a comment character in [Mail::colorizeWindow].
• New [Mail::findBrowserWindow] procedure to locate Mailbox window.
• New [Mail::floatMailboxMessages] procedure used to create floating pallete.
  Preferred to [floatNamedMarks] because selecting an item opens the e-mail.
• Added "-exact" flag to all [lsearch] calls.  (I thought this was the default.)
• Added "openHook" registration, workaround for bug# 1722.
• Better "MailmodeVars(wordBreak)" default value to highlight e-mail addresses.
• The "rememberWindowGeometry" pref is obsolete, geometry is always remembered.
• If the "renderHtmlFormattedText" pref is turned on, we attempt to ignore any
  plain text message parts if html formatted text has also been offered.
• Mail Menu v 2.0b6
• New Contextual Menu modules for "Mail Window" and "New Message To" menus.
• New "mailWindows.tcl" file for all window management procedures.
• New [Mail::getWindowType] procedure.  This makes the code much cleaner,
  avoiding all of those [catch {Mail::requireMailWindow ...}] calls.
• New [Mail::findViewerWindow] procedure.
• Better "(prev/next)Message" identification when active window is a viewer.
  (We don't assume that the browsing window position is for viewer window.)
• New [Mail::DblClick] piggybacks on [Tcl::DblClick] when appropriate.
• New [Mail::parseMessage] to handle "content-type: message/rfc822" mime parts.
• New [Mail::setFillColumn] used to break lines in [Mail::parseText].
• [Mail::colorizeMailWindow] renamed to [Mail::colorizeWindow].
• New "warnWhenMessageExceeds" pref for the Alpha handler to ensure that we
  don't start downloading a 2 MByte e-mail message.
• Ensure that WWW mode is loaded to use its color/style pref values.
• New "Mail Menu > Html Colors & Styles" menu item for the Alpha handler.
• If we're ignoring some "multipart/alternative" message part, we still cache it
  (html or text) in case it turns out to be the only one that was available.
• Improved [Mail::DblClick] checking for AlphaTcl e-mails.
• [Mail::getFieldValue] fix for "New Mail" windows.
• "Add Cc/Bcc" are dynamic items, actually work now, and along with "Forward"
  offer the user the list of saved e-mail addresses.
• Better "X-Mailer" value for the Alpha handler.
• Improved internal variable handling in the Alpha handler.
• New [Mail::tcllib::checkMessageSize] and [Mail::tcllib::calculateSize] procs.
• Message size checked if we have to use [::pop3::retrieve] to open Inbox.
• Mailbox browsing windows include each message's index number.
• New [Mail::parseEmailField] properly quotes "real names" in header fields.
• [Mail::replyToEmail] breaks long lines with leading prefix string.
• Improved status bar messages, indicating index number of mail message.
• New [Mail::tcllib::getEnvelope] takes care of [::pop3::top] failure.
• Alpha handler message envelopes and contents stored in arrays, not flat lists.
  This also allows us to avoid re-downloading messages we've already seen.
• "View Full Header" windows are now unique to the message's index number.
  Again, we no longer need to re-download messages we've already seen.
• New [Mail::parseHeaderField] converts quoted-printable subject lines.
• [Mail::tcllib::checkMessageSize] only accepts a single index argument.
• Mailbox browsing window auto-adjusts e-mail column width.
• "Mail Menu > Add (Bcc|Cc)" properly positions the addition on a new line,
  and properly delimits items with a comma.
• Mail Menu v 2.0b7
• New [Mail::nextPrevMessage] and [Mail::addField] procs in "mailWindows.tcl".
• New "newerMessagesListedFirst" pref reverses Mailbox browsing window items.
• New "Sent" and "Drafts" folders for saving composed e-mails.
• New "saveCopyOfSentMail" preference to auto-save sent e-mails.
• The "killWindowAfterSend" preference is now "1" since we save e-mails.
• If a New Mail window has not been sent, we offer to save it on close.
• New "Mail Menu > Open Saved Draft" menu item to display all drafts.
• New "Mail Menu > Sent Mail" submenu with toggleable pref and display items.
• New [Mail::rebuildMenu] procedure handles hook calling when necessary.
• Minor [activateHook] cleanup for various window types.
• Fix to Eudora menu insertion/building for "addCc…" vs "<E<SaddCc…".
• Toggleable prefs removed from "Eudora Options" menu, they're in "Sent Mail".
• [Mail::requireMailWindow] can accept multiple window type arguments.
• Sent message windows can be forwarded.
• The "Mail Menu > Forward" item is standard, handlers do not add it.
• New "multipleMailViewWindows" preference, put subject lines in window titles.
• Each window registers a "windowType" entry when it is created.
• [Mail::selectNextField] works in Mailbox browsing windows.
• Fix to [Mail::tcllib::flushPasswords] so that it actually works.
• Add "Help" buttons to most of the dialogs in all files.
• Each identity can set a unique "Reply-To" e-mail address (Alpha handler.)
• Each identity now has "Email Address" and "Real Name" fields.
• Real names added to "From" field in [Mail::tcllib::PrepareToSend].
• Better parsing of "User Account" name from Email Address.
• Better parsing of header fields in [Mail::sendCreatedMsg].
• Saved e-mails entries can now include Real Names and Comments.
• Minor variable cleanup, annotation.  (This update is almost complete.)
  Mail Menu v 2.0fc1
• New 'quotedTextShouldBe' preference: plain, colorized, italicized, both.
• New menu binding preference for "Mail Menu > Save As Draft".
• [Mail::selectNextField] respects "Special Keys" binding in New Mail windows.
• [Mail::rebuildMenu] is no longer necessary, thanks to SystemCode menu changes.
• New "menuBuild" hooks registered to properly dim/enable items in "mailMenu".
• The "winName" arguement in all activateHook procedures is now optional, the
  name of the active window is used if none is supplied.
• New "confirmBeforeSending" preference.
• Removed "openHook" registration workarounds for bug# 1722.
• Fixed "$from$tag" bug which wasn't incrementing the tag for browsing windows.
• Mail Menu v 2.0fc2
• "Mail" mode no longer exists.  All windows are in Text mode, with minor-modes.
• We make sure that [Mail::initializeMode] is always called before other code.
  (It might be possible to relax this with some minor re-organization, but for
  now this is the safest route.)
• Mail Menu v 2.0fc3
• Removed obsolete code tagged for removal.
• Port numbers can be set for the Alpha mail handler.
• New "autoFloatMessageMarks" preference for Mail View windows.
• "Fill Column" workarounds for bugs 1783, 1788 (Alpha8/X, [getTextDimensions]).
• Port numbers are parsed from server names, no longer a separate field to set.
• "text/enriched" MIME content-type field values handled like "text/html".

================================================================================

• Transitioning to Tcl 8.0 namespace/variable handling.
• Preferences overhaul, new [Mail::modePrefsDialog].
• We hide the Eudora prefs when that is not the handler.

================================================================================

• There are now three possible plug-ins: eudora (works as before with
  apple-events), tclmail (not really implemented, but can use the smtp library
  from tcllib to send mail directly), and 'system', which simply uses your
  system configuration for 'mailto:' urls to send mail.

================================================================================
= 0.1 released                             last update: 12/08/2000 {11:44:26 AM}
