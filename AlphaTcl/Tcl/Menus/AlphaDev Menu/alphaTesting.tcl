This window contains the history of calls made to the proc: alpha::log .
These messages are displayed in the status bar (and in any open AlphaTcl
Shell window), but are also retained in a cache for viewing later.  Some of
these messages were created during the initialization of AlphaTcl.

To use [alpha::log] in debugging, supply a channel and a string as arguments.
Typical channels are "stdout" and "stderr".  For example, you could include

	alpha::log "stdout" "current var value: $var"

to record the value of a variable created during one of your procedures.
Then select "AlphaDev > Alpha Testing > Review alpha::log Cache" after
performing the operation to review the contents.

 # "alphadev::testing::listSourcedFiles" --
 # 
 # List all currently sourced files, based on currently defined procedures
 # and "auto_index" entries as described below in the "header" section.
 # 
 # When we create the list of files, we go to a little bit of trouble of
 # group them according to their directory names, separating each by an empty
 # line.  It looks a little convoluted, but it works fairly well.
 # 
 # When called from the "AlphaDev Menu > Testing" menu item, all of the
 # AlphaDev source files will of course be included, as well as anything that
 # was required to build and insert this menu.
 # 
 # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # 
 # To determine which files are sourced during Alpha8/X/tk's startup, turn
 # off all global menus and features except the AlphaDev menu, restart, and
 # then call the "AlphaDev Menu > Alpha Testing > List Sourced Files" menu
 # item.  Of course, since the AlphaDev menu is still globally active the
 # activation of this menu sourced additional files, so to be more precise
 # you could add the [alphadev::testing::listSourcedFiles] procedure to
 # your "prefs.tcl" file and call it there.  Turning off _all_ menus and
 # features will make this list more meaningful for this purpose.  Don't
 # forget to include [namespace eval alphadev::testing {}] in the
 # "prefs.tcl" file!
 # 
 # One more caveat -- the proc [procs::buildList] is used here, so its source
 # file will of course be included in the list as well.  Define that in your
 # "prefs.tcl" file as well if that is an important distinction.
 # 
 # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # 
 # You can also use this item to determine what additional files are sourced
 # when a package is first activated -- just follow these steps:
 # 
 # (1) Turn off the feature
 # (2) Restart Alpha8/X/tk
 # (3) Create the initial list
 # (4) Turn on a package
 # (5) Create a new list
 # (6) Compare the two windows

	  	Loading Modes and Menus

Using the "Alpha Testing > Load All Menus/Modes" menu items, you can
evaluate the activation scripts for menus/modes.  A new window will then be
opened listing all of the new global variables that were created by the
scripts.  The "Alpha Testing > Open Document All Modes" will go one step
further and create a new window for each mode.

The "Alpha Testing > List Sourced Files" will create a new window listing
all of the current files that have been sourced by ALPHA which have defined
indexed procedures.  (See the window's annotation for more information.)

	  	Test Suite Files

One of the most important steps in addressing bugs or implementing new
functionality is the proper testing of any changes.  An essential part of
development involves designing tests that can be performed by other
developers to confirm that some new behavior doesn't introduce additional
bugs.  The best way to do this systematically is to create a test file, one
that is both well-documented and used whenever a proposed change is
considered for inclusion in the AlphaTcl CVS.

The menu item "Alpha Testing > Open Test Suite Window" offers a list-pick
dialog containing the names of all files in the directory

	$HOME/Developer/Tests/

This directory is not included in the standard distribution, but is uploaded
when the 'AlphaTclDevel' module is updated from the CVS. (Click on this
hyperlink <<alphadev::cvs::helpWindow>> for more information.)

When you choose a particular test from the list-pick dialog, the contents
of that file is inserted into a new window.  Ideally, this window includes
information on how the test(s) should be performed.  If it is necessary to
perform the test on a file that actually exists, you can save this window
somewhere in your file system.  Some test file windows are in Tcl mode, and
simply require "evaluating" the contents.

The menu item "Alpha Testing > Create Test Suite Window" prompts you for a
name for a new file that will be created in the Tests folder.  If you feel
that this file would be useful for other developers, you can send an
archive of it to a member of the AlphaTcl development team that has
write-access to the CVS.

	  	Timing Data

AlphaTcl includes built-in timing capabilities, which are implemented with
the proc: alpha::recordTimingData .  When ALPHA is first launched, all of
the various AlphaTcl initialization steps are recorded in the database.
When you select "Alpha Testing > Display Timing Data" the contents of this
database are re-formatted and placed in a new "* Timing Data *" window.
This information can be used to optimize the initialization sequence.

Note that whenever a file is sourced using [source] (or is auto_loaded), a
new timing entry is automatically placed in the database.

Developers can also record other steps that take place in any procedure or
source file -- just add a line like

	alpha::recordTimingData "Starting this procedure..."

somewhere in the body of the procedure or file.  This is most useful when
timing data is recorded in pairs, so that you can tell when something
starts and is later finished.  Select "Alpha Testing > Flush Timing Data"
at any time to clear the database when it contains information that you
don't want or need anymore.  If you want to clear the data before each test
of your Tcl routine, include

	alphadev::testing::flushTimingData

at the start of the procedure or file.  If you want to automatically create
the timing data report window when the procedure has finished, include

	alphadev::testing::displayTimingData

at the end of it.  The "Alpha Testing > Time AlphaTcl Proc" menu item will
open a dialog allowing you to enter the name of a procedure to time, and
automatically place the necessary code within the proc's body for you.


	  	Miscellaneous Procedures

There are several more procedures in the "alphaTesting.tcl" file that you
might find useful, which are not available via the "AlphaDev > Alpha Testing"
menu.  They include

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proc: procs::findAllProcUsage

<<procs::findAllProcUsage>>

This will prompt you to locate a directory, and then specify a list of
procedures.  It will then scan all files in that directory to find all calls
to those procedures.  This routine is perhaps the most useful of the bunch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proc: procs::findObsAlphaTclProcs

<<procs::findObsAlphaTclProcs>>

This will prompt you to specify a category of obsolete commands/procedures as
well as a list of items to ignore, and then scan the AlphaTcl library for all
usage of these items.  These lists of obsolete items are been created
elsewhere by the AlphaDev Menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proc: procs::findUnlistedCmds

<<procs::findUnlistedCmds>>

This will list all of the core AlphaX commands that are not documented in the
"Alpha Commands" file, as well as Tcl commands not in "Tcl 8.4 Commands".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proc: procs::findUsageFrequency

<<procs::findUsageFrequency>>

This will prompt you to locate a directory containing a "tclIndex" file.  All
of the procedures defined in that index file are gathered, and then each file
within the chosen directory will be scanned to determine how many times each
procedure is referenced.  Yes, the usefulness of this information is somewhat
questionable.  It will take quite a while to collect the results, since each
file is scanned for each procedure.
