<HR><P><H2><A NAME="anchor1"></A> AppleScript mode Tutorial</H2><P>This is a tutorial that demonstrates the "AppleScript  mode".  It  requires
Alpha8 or greater and won't work with  Alpha7  because  it  relies  on  the
Tclapplescript.shlb shared library which needs Tcl 8.0 or greater.
For Alpha7 a minimal set of functionalities is implemented though:  editing
scripts, syntax coloring, running a compiled script.<P>AppleScript mode lets you use Alpha as the  front  end  editor  to  create,
manipulate and execute your AppleScripts and take advantage of its powerful 
editing capacities.<P>In order to use AppleScript mode in Alpha,  you  must  first  activate  the
AppleScript menu. This can be done in different manners :
<UL>
	<LI> - selecting the menu item "Config --&gt; Preferences  --&gt;  Menus..."  and
choosing 'AppleScript Menu' (checking the corresponding checkbox)
	<LI> - editing a file in this mode: open a new file and  select  "Scrp"  in
the right most popup window on the status bar. Note that the mode  will  be
triggered automatically if the file has one of  the  following  extensions:
".script", ".scr", ".scpt" or ".ascr". When a file is in AppleScript  mode,
the AppleScript menu is automatically displayed in the menu bar.
	<LI> - opening with Alpha a source file  which  has  been  created  by  the
application "AppleScript Editor" will also  edit  it  in  AppleScript  mode
automatically. <P></UL><P>AppleScript mode is identified by the four-letters code "Scrp" in the  mode
pop-up at the right of the status bar. <P>The AppleScript mode allows you to achieve  with  maximum  flexibility  all
kinds of operations concerning scripts written in the AppleScript language,
such as editing, compiling, decompiling, executing and processing. Advanced
features include compilation of context  files,  execution  of  scripts  in
contexts etc.<P>Note that the AppleScript Editor application does not have to  be  launched
or even present on your computer for this mode to work. It  relies  on  the
Tclapplescript.shlb shared library which interacts directly with the  MacOS
Open Scripting Architecture. This shared library must be present and should
be located (itself or an alias) in the "Tool Command Language" subfolder of
the "Extensions" folder inside the System folder.<P>This Tutorial, when opened from the  Help  menu  in  Alpha,  is  a  "shell"
window. None of the changes you make will affect the actual  file.  If  you
close the window and then click on the hyperlink again, you will start with
the same example as before. Note that "Undo"  is  not  available  in  shell
windows. <P>The AppleScript mode menu can also be invoked while you are working in  any
mode in Alpha. You could have AppleScripts related  to  various  tasks  and
trigger them when necessary.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor2"></A> First example: creating a script file</H3><P>To create a new script, choose "New Script" from the AppleScript menu: this
simply opens in Alpha, directly in AppleScript mode, a new editing  window.
You are asked to provide a name: name it for instance "Weekday.scpt".<P>Type in the following instructions:
<PRE>
 tell application "Finder"
         weekday of (current date) as text
 end tell
</PRE>
Then choose "Execute" from the AppleScript menu. This  compiles  internally
the contents of your window and executes the compiled script. The result is
displayed in a second window called "* AppleScript Results *". All the data
resulting from the execution of various scripts will be  appended  to  this
window which you can save if necessary. In our case, the  result should  be
the name of the current day. For example :
<PRE>
 "Thursday"
</PRE><P><H3><A NAME="anchor3"></A> Second example: compiling a script</H3><P>You can make a compiled version of your script  using  the  "Compile"  item
from the AppleScript menu. This will allow you later to execute the  script
by just choosing it in the "Scripts"  submenu.  The  "Weekday.scpt"  script
will be compiled with the name "Weekday".
When a script is compiled, if the window does not correspond yet to a  file
on disk (newly created script using the "New Script"  item),  the  compiled
script will be written  in  the  AppleScripts  folder  in  Alpha's  folder.
Otherwise the compiled script will be in the same folder as the text  file.
You can execute any of the scripts stored in this folder by just  selecting
them in the "Scripts" submenu of the AppleScript menu.<P>If you want to re-edit a compiled script, choose the "Open Script" item  in
the AppleScript menu or, alternatively, open the  "Scripts"  submenu  while
holding the option key down. In this case all  the  items  become  editable
instead of executable: for example, if the option key is pressed  the  item
"Weekday" changes to "&#8226;edit&#8226; Weekday".<P>You can also run any compiled script located on  your  computer  using  the
"Run..." item in the AppleScript menu. A dialog window lets you browse in the
files hierarchy to select the compiled script you want to run.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor4"></A> Third example: adding a comment</H3><P>A descriptive comment can be stored in the compiled script  to  explain  to
the users how the script works or what it does. AppleScript mode is able to
deal with these comments. You must check the  "Include  Description"  check
box in the AppleScript mode preferences: to do this, open the "Preferences"
item of the "Scrp Prefs" submenu of the "Config" menu (you must already  be
in AppleScript mode).<P>When the "Include Description" preference is  set,  AppleScript  mode  will
display the comment (if there is one) when it edits a script.  The  comment
will be displayed at the beginning of the script like this:
<PRE>
 (* Description
 	    Text of the comment here
 *)
</PRE>
You can also create a comment yourself using the same syntax.  Try  to  add
the following to the previous example (choose the "Add Comment" item in the
menu to insert a template automatically):
<PRE>
 (* Description
    This script finds the name of the current day.
 *)
</PRE>
Make sure that the "Include Description" preference is on and  compile  the
script. Next time you edit the script, your comment will be there. You  can
also open your script with the AppleScript Editor instead of Alpha and  see
that the comment is there in the  description  field  at  the  top  of  the
editing window.<P> 
<H3><A NAME="anchor5"></A> Fourth example: evaluating a compiled script in a Tcl proc</H3><P>You can run an already existing compiled script from a Tcl procedure or any
piece of Tcl code with the Scrp::doRun procedure like this:
<PRE>
 global HOME
 set file [file join $HOME AppleScripts Weekday]
 Scrp::doRun $file
</PRE><P>You pass the full path name of your script as the first argument. This proc
returns the result of the execution of the script.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor6"></A> Fifth example: evaluating a script on the fly</H3><P>The procedures defined in the AppleScript Mode files can be used  in  other
Tcl scripts and allow you to evaluate AppleScript scripts on the fly inside
a Tcl script. This way some variables can be evaluated at run time.<P>Here is a simple example.  It  defines  a  Tcl  proc  which  will  add  the
currently opened file to the Favorites menu of the MacOS Finder.
<PRE>
 proc addToFavorites {} {
     set currfile [win::Current]
     if {[file exists $currfile]} {
 	set scripttext "tell application \"Finder\"
 	add to favorites \{file \"$currfile\"\}
 	end tell"
 	Scrp::doExecute $scripttext
 	message "Added '[file tail $currfile]' to favorites"
     } 
 }
</PRE>
Make sure you escape  the  quotes  and  braces  with  a  backslash  in  the
definition of the text string.<P>So there  are  basically  two  ways  of  using  the  AppleScript  scripting
component from Alpha:
<UL>
	<LI> you can have predefined compiled scripts in the AppleScripts folder or
anywhere on your computer and execute them with Scrp::doRun
	<LI> you can build a text script and have it executed on the fly,  like  in
the previous example, with Scrp::doExecute.<P></UL><P><H2><A NAME="anchor7"></A> Advanced matters</H2>
AppleScript Mode allows you to compile scripts in specific contexts and not
only in the global context. A context, in AppleScript parlance, is  like  a
namespace : it is an environment in which some  variables,  functions  (aka
handlers) etc. are defined and are accessible to all the scripts  you  want
to run in this context. Thanks to the contexts different scripts can  share
variables and data.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor8"></A> Compiling a context script</H3>
To compile a script as a context, just select the flag  "Make  Context"  in
the Apple Script Flags submenu. The compiled script will be refered to as a
context script.
<P> For instance, let's create a new script called VarContext.scpt with the
following instruction :
<PRE>
 set theSig to "ALFA"
</PRE>
and compile it as a context. We obtain a compiled script called VarContext 
which will be added to the Scripts submenu.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor9"></A> Running a script in a context</H3>
To run a script in a context, you must: 
<OL>
	<LI> set the flag "Run in context" in the Apple Script Flags submenu.
	<LI> select a context. This is done by opening the  Scripts  submenu  while
pressing the Control key down and selecting an  item.  This  item  will  be
marked with a bullet showing that it is the current context.<P></OL>
Here is an example. Let's create a script called NameFromSig.scpt with  the
following instructions  asking  the  Finder  to  return  the  name  of  the
application whose signature is the value of the variable theSig:
<PRE>
 tell application "Finder"
  	name of application file id theSig
 end tell
</PRE>
Note that theSig is a variable and that it is NOT defined in  this  script.
You can compile this script normally. This will result in a compiled script
called NameFromSig. If you run this  script  (with  the  Run  item  in  the
AppleScript menu), you will have an  error  message  because  the  variable
theSig is not defined.  Now  run  the  script  in  the  context  VarContext
previously defined : set the flag "Run in  context"  in  the  Apple  Script
Flags submenu, open the Scripts submenu with the Control key down to select
VarContext then run NameFromSig (NameFromSig.scpt is  still  the  frontmost
window). This time no error and the result is written  in  the  AppleScript
Results window like this :
<PRE>
 "Alpha8"
</PRE><P><H3><A NAME="anchor10"></A> Inheriting from a parent context</H3>
A context script can inherit the properties, data, variables, handlers etc.
defined in another (already compiled) context. This  context  is  called  a
parent context: the new context will contain all the  data  it  defines  as
well as all the data defined in its parent. To compile a  context  and  let
him inherit from a parent context you must:
<OL>
	<LI> set the flag "Inherit from parent" in the Apple Script Flags submenu.
	<LI> select a parent context. This is done by opening the  Scripts  submenu
while pressing the Shift key down and selecting an item. This item will  be
marked with a diamond showing that it is the current parent.<P></OL>
Example: let's make a context called Inherit.scpt with the following 
instruction:
<PRE>
 tell application "Finder"
     set theFolder to {container of application file id theSig}
 end tell
</PRE>
This instruction defines a variable theFolder which designates  the  folder
containing the application whose creator type is theSig. Once again  theSig
is not defined in this file but we are going to  compile  it  and  let  him
inherit from the VarContext script which defines  theSig  :  set  the  flag
"Inherit from parent" in the Apple Script Flags submenu, open  the  Scripts
submenu with the Shift key down to select VarContext, then compile.
<P> The resulting Inherit script can be tested like this. Suppose you  have
a file called "HD:Dissertation:Conclusion.tcl" that  we  want  to  copy  to
Alpha's folder. Let's make  a  script  called  CopyToFolder.scpt  with  the
following instructions:
<PRE>
 set thefile to "HD:Dissertation:Conclusion.tcl"
 tell application "Finder" to duplicate file thefile to theFolder
</PRE>
Now compile this script normally, then run it in  the  VarContext  context:
the variable theFolder is defined in this context. Its definition uses  the
variable theSig which was defined  initially  in  the  parent  context  and
transmitted to the VarContext context.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor11"></A> Augmenting a context</H3>
If a script has been compiled as a context and its instructions  have  been
modified, there are two possibilities when you recompile  the  script:  the
new instructions can replace the previous ones or they can be added to what
was previously defined. This is controlled by the flag "Augment Context" in
the Apple Script Flags submenu.
<P> Example: let's  define  a  script  Variables.scpt  with  the  following
instruction: 
<PRE>
 set theSig1 "ALFA"
</PRE>
and compile it as a context script. Then replace the  instruction  by  this
one (i-e delete the preceding instruction):
<PRE>
 set theSig2 "MOSS"
</PRE>
and recompile the script with the flag "Augment Context" set. The resulting
context script Variables will  make  both  variables  theSig1  and  theSig2
available. <P><H3><A NAME="anchor12"></A> Getting the scripting terminology of an application</H3>
To drive an application with an AppleScript, one must know which terms this
application understands.  Each  application  defines  its  own  terminology
depending on the kind of service it provides. The terminology can be stored
in different ways:
<UL>
	<LI> in a static way. It is stored in the resource fork of the  application
(systems prior to OSX) in resources of type 'aete'. Static  terminology  is
the most current situation.
	<LI> in a dynamic way. The application accepts an event called  "Get  AETE"
and  returns  all  the  terminology  to  the  caller.  It  concerns  mainly
applications who support plugins and extensions. All the plugins  can  have
their own dictionary and the application is responsible for  gathering  the
terminology for all of them. This can't be done in the static way since you
don't know in advance which plugins are currently available or loaded.<P></UL>
Alpha8 has dynamic terminology and  Alpha7  has  static  terminology.  With
dynamic terminology, the application must be running to be able to  receive
the "Get AETE" request and to reply: if it is not running, it will have  to
be launched, which in some cases can take time. With static terminology,the
application does not have to be running,  nor  launched.  AppleScript  Mode
takes care of launching the application when  necessary.  Usually,  dynamic
terminology includes the static terminology.
<P> AppleScript Mode has a flag called "Launch To  Get  Terminology"  which
lets you decide if you accept that the application be launched to  retreive
its dictionary. Setting this flag or not is a blind guess  because  you  do
not know in advance if the application has dynamic terminology but,  if  it
does and if the flag  is  not  on,  AppleScript  Mode  will  let  you  know
immediately and offer the choice of putting the flag on. If the application
does not have dynamic terminology and the flag is on, AppleScript Mode will
look for static terminology anyway.<P><H2><A NAME="anchor13"></A> AppleScript mode Key Bindings</H2><P>Most of the actions can be triggered from the keyboard instead  of  opening
AppleScript menu. All of them are obtained by typing 'ctrl-a' followed by a
letter to specify which command you are interested in.
