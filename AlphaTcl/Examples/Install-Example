 # 
 # If you want to modify this example to create an actual Open To Install
 # file for your own Alpha package, save a copy of this file somewhere in
 # the :Tcl directory, and then open and edit it as needed.
 # 
 # To modify this file and turn it into an actual "Open To Install" script,
 # here are some suggestions.
 # 
 #   ¥ Replace "Install Example" with the name of your mode, package, etc.
 #   ¥ Remove the last line, "  -ignore ...  ".
 #   ¥ Remove the \ (command continue marker) on the second to last line.
 #   ¥ Put in your own message!
 # 
 # To separate portions of text with an empty line, type a <space> after the
 # backslash (\).  I don't know why this works, but it does.  The empty lines
 # that appear below are visual markers only, and do not create spaces.
 # 
 # It is also recommended that you create specific folders adjacent to the 
 # Open To Install file to help direct installation, i.e. Help, Modes, Menus, 
 # Packages, etc.  Otherwise the installation proc will make some educated 
 # guesses about where your files should be installed.
 # 
 # The " -ignore " option is just one of several available with the install
 # proc.  See the Extending Alpha file for more installation script options.
 #

# We need to be sure that nothing in this folder gets installed.
