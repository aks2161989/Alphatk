<H2><A NAME="A1.2">What This Primer Doesn't Cover</A></H2>

This primer assumes that you have:

<UL>
    <LI>at least a passing knowledge of how to use NCSA Mosaic or some other 
    Web browser
    <LI>a general understanding of how Web servers and client browsers work
    <LI>access to a Web server for which you would like to produce HTML 
    documents, or that you wish to produce HTML documents for personal use
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="A1.3">Creating HTML Documents</A></H2>

HTML documents are in plain (also known as ASCII) text format and can be 
created using any text editor (e.g., EMACS or vi on UNIX machines).  A 
couple of Web browsers (tkWWW for X Window System machines and CERN's Web 
browser for NeXT computers) include rudimentary HTML editors in a WYSIWYG 
environment, and you may wish to try one of them first before delving into 
the details of HTML.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>You can preview a document in progress with NCSA Mosaic (and some 
</I><I>other Web browsers). Open it with the </I><B>Open Local 
</B><I>command under the </I><B>File</B><I> menu. </I>

<P>
<I>After you edit the source HTML file, save the changes. Return to NCSA 
</I><I>Mosaic and </I><B>Reload</B><I> the document. The changes are 
reflected in the on-</I><I>screen display.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="A1.3.1">The Minimal HTML Document</A></H3>

Here is a bare-bones example of HTML:

<PRE>   
&lt;TITLE&gt;The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;This is a level-one heading&lt;/H1&gt;
Welcome to the world of HTML. 
This is one paragraph.&lt;P&gt;
And this is a second.&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
HTML uses markup tags to tell the Web browser how to display the text.The 
above example uses:

<UL>
    <LI>the <SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP> tag (and corresponding 
    <SAMP>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</SAMP> tag), which specifies the title of the document
    <LI>the <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> header tag (and corresponding 
    <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>)
    <LI>the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph-separator tag
</UL>

<P>
HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<SAMP>&lt;</SAMP>), (a ``less 
than'' symbol to mathematicians), followed by name of the tag and closed by 
a right angular bracket (<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>). Tags are usually paired,e.g. 
<SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>. The ending tag looks 
just like the starting tag except a slash (/) precedes the text within the 
brackets. In the example, <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> tells the browser to 
start formatting a level-one heading; <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>tells the 
browser that the heading is complete.

<P>
The primary exception to the pairing rule is the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>tag. 
There is no such thing as <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP>.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG><I> HTML is not case sensitive. 
</I><SAMP>&lt;title&gt;</SAMP><I>is equivalent to 
</I><SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP><I> or </I><SAMP>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</SAMP><I>.</I>

<P>
Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browser 
does not support a tag, it just ignores it.

<H3><A NAME="A1.3.2">Basic Markup Tags</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.2.1">Title</A></H4>

Every HTML document should have a title. A title is generally displayed 
separately from the document and is used primarily for document 
identification in other contexts (e.g., a WAIS search). Choose about half a 
dozen words that describe the document's purpose.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>In the X Window System and Microsoft Windows versions of NCSA 
</I><I>Mosaic, the </I><B>Document Title</B><I> field is at the top of the 
screen just below the </I><I>pulldown menus. In NCSA Mosaic for Macintosh, 
text tagged as </I><SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP><I>appears as the window 
title.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.2.2">Headings</A></H4>

HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being the 
most prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolder fonts than 
normal body text. The first heading in each document should be tagged 
<SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>. The syntax of the heading tag is:

<P>
<SAMP>&lt;H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP><VAR>Text of 
heading</VAR><SAMP>&lt;/H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP> &gt;</SAMP>

<P>
where <VAR>y</VAR> is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level of the 
heading.

<P>
For example, the coding for the ``Headings'' section heading above is

<PRE>
&lt;H3&gt;Headings&lt;/H3&gt;
</PRE>

<H5><A NAME="A1.3.2.2.1">Title versus first heading</A></H5>

In many documents, the first heading is identical to the title. For 
multi-part documents, the text of the first heading should be suitable for 
a reader who is already browsing related information (e.g., a chapter 
title), while the title tag should identify the document in a wider context 
(e.g., include both the book title and the chapter title, although this can 
sometimes become overly long).

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.2.3">Paragraphs</A></H4>

Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTML files 
aren't significant.  Word wrapping can occur at any point in your source 
file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space.  (There are 
couple of exceptions; space following a <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>or 
<SAMP>&lt;H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP> tag , for example,is 
ignored.) Notice that in the bare-bones example, the first paragraph is 
coded as

<PRE>
Welcome to HTML. 
This is the first paragraph. &lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
In the source file, there is a line break between the sentences. A Web 
browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph only when it 
reaches a <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tag.

<P>
<STRONG>Important:</STRONG> You must separate paragraphs with 
<SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>.  The browser ignores any indentations or blank 
lines in the source text.HTML relies almost entirely on the tags for 
formatting instructions,and without the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tags, the 
document would become one large paragraph.  (The exception is text tagged 
as ``preformatted,''explained below.)  For instance, the following would 
produce identical output as the first barebones HTML example:

<PRE>
&lt;TITLE&gt;The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;This is a level one heading&lt;/H1&gt;
Welcome to the world of HTML. This is one paragraph.&lt;P&gt;And this is a second.&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
However, to preserve readability in HTML files, headings should be on 
separate lines, and paragraphs should be separated by blank lines (in 
addition to the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tags).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>NCSA Mosaic handles &lt;P&gt; by ending the current paragraph and 
insert</I><I>ing a blank line. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In HTML+, a successor to HTML currently in development, 
<SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>becomes a ``container'' of text, just as the text of 
a level-one heading is ``contained'' within<SAMP>&lt;H1&gt; ... 
</SAMP><SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>:

<PRE>
&lt;P&gt;This is a paragraph in HTML+.&lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The difference is that the <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> closing tag can always 
be omitted. (That is, if a browser sees a <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>,it knows 
that there must be an implied <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> to end the previous 
paragraph.) In other words, in HTML+, <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>is a 
beginning-of-paragraph marker.

<P>
The advantage of this change is that you will be able to specify formatting 
options for a paragraph. For example, in HTML+, you will be able to center 
a paragraph by coding

<PRE>
<SAMP>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</SAMP>
This is a centered paragraph. This is HTML+, so you can't do it yet.
</PRE>

<P>
This change won't effect any documents you write now, and they will 
continue to look just the same with HTML+ browsers.

<P>
In fact, starting <EM>every</EM> paragraph with <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>,even 
currently with HTML, would be a good habit to start acquiring.As noted, 
it's not required, but it will ease your transition to HTML+.Browsers 
should ignore any unnecessary <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>s.

<H3><A NAME="A1.3.3">Linking to Other Documents</A></H3>

The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link regions of text (and 
also images) to another document. These regions are typically highlighted 
by the browser to indicate that they are hypertext links (often shorted to 
<DFN>hyperlinks</DFN> or simply <DFN>links</DFN>).

<P>
HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <SAMP>&lt;A&gt;</SAMP>, which stands 
for <DFN>anchor</DFN>. To include an anchor in your document:

<OL>
    <LI>Start the anchor with the left angle bracket and the anchor directive 
    followed by a space: <SAMP>&lt;A</SAMP> .
    <LI>Specify the document that's being pointed to by giving the parameter 
    <SAMP>HREF=&quot;</SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>&quot;</SAMP> followed by 
    a closing angle bracket: <SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>
    <LI>Enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current 
    document.
    <LI>Enter the ending anchor tag: <SAMP>&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP>.
</OL>

<P>
Here is an sample hypertext reference:

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;MaineStats.html&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This entry makes word ``Maine'' the hyperlink to the document 
<SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>, which is in the same directory as the first 
document. You can link to documents in other directories by specifying the 
<DFN>relative path</DFN>from the current document to the linked document. 
For example, a link  to a file <SAMP>NJStats.html</SAMP> located in the 
subdirectory <SAMP>AtlanticStates</SAMP>would be:

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;AtlanticStates/NJStats.html&quot;&gt;New Jersey&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
These are called <VAR>relative links</VAR>. You can also use the absolute 
pathname of the file if you wish.

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.3.1">Relative Links Versus Absolute Pathnames</A></H4>

In general, you should use relative links, because

<OL>
    <LI>You have less to type.
    <LI>It's easier to move a group of documents to another location, because 
    the relative path names will still be valid.
</OL>

<P>
However, use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that are not 
directly related.  For example, consider a group of documents that comprise 
a user manual.  Links within this group should be relative links.  Links to 
other documents (perhaps a reference to related software) should use full 
path names.  This way, if you move the user manual to a different 
directory, none of the links would have to be updated.

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.3.2">Uniform Resource Locator</A></H4>

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) refers to the format used by World Wide 
Web documents to locate files on other servers.  A URL gives the type of 
resource being accessed (e.g., gopher, WAIS) and the path of the file. The 
syntax is:

<P>
<VAR>scheme</VAR><SAMP>://</SAMP><VAR>host.domain</VAR><SAMP>[:</SAMP><VAR>port</VAR><SAMP>]/</SAMP><VAR>path</VAR><SAMP>/</SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR>

<P>
where <VAR>scheme</VAR> is one of

<DL COMPACT>
    <DT><SAMP>file</SAMP><DD>
    <DT><DD>a file on your local system, or a file on an anonymous FTP server
    <DT><SAMP>http</SAMP><DD>a file on a World Wide Web server
    <DT><SAMP>gopher</SAMP><DD>a file on a Gopher server
    <DT><SAMP>WAIS</SAMP><DD>a file on a WAIS server
    <DT><SAMP>news</SAMP><DD>an Usenet newsgroup
    <DT><SAMP>telnet</SAMP><DD>a connection to a Telnet-based service
</DL>

<P>
The port number can generally be omitted.  (Which means, unless someone 
tells you otherwise, leave it out.)

<P>
For example if you wanted to insert a link to this primer, you would 
include

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html&quot;&gt;
NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
in your document. This would make the text ``NCSA's Beginner's Guide to 
HTML'' a hyperlink leading to this document.

<P>
For more information on URLs, look at

<UL>
    <LI>the Addressing document, written by CERN (the high energy physics 
    people in Switzerland who originated the World Wide Web)
    <LI><CITE>A Beginner's Guide to URLs</CITE>, located on the NCSA Mosaic 
    <B>Help</B> menu
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.3.3">Anchors to Specific Sections in Other 
Documents</A></H4>

Anchors can also be used to move to a particular section in a document. 
Suppose you wish to set a link from document A and a specific section in 
document B.  First you need to set up a <DFN>named anchor</DFN> in document 
B.  For example, to add an anchor named ``Jabberwocky'' to document B, you 
would insert

<PRE>
Here's &lt;A NAME=&quot;Jabberwocky&quot;&gt;some text&lt;/a&gt;.
</PRE>

<P>
Now when you create the link in document A, you include not only the 
filename, but also the named anchor, separated by a hash mark (#).

<PRE>
This is my &lt;A HREF=&quot;documentB.html#Jabberwocky&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to document B.
</PRE>

<P>
Now clicking on the word ``link'' in document A sends the reader directly 
to the words ``some text'' in document B.

<H4><A NAME="A1.3.3.4">Anchors to Specific Sections within the Current 
Document</A></H4>

The technique is exactly the same except the file name is now omitted.

<P>
For example, to link to the ``Jabberwocky'' anchor from within the same 
file (Document B), you would use

<PRE>
This is &lt;A HREF=&quot;#Jabberwocky&quot;&gt;Jabberwocky link&lt;/A&gt;
from within Document B.
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="A1.4">Additional Markup Tags</A></H2>

The above is sufficient to produce simple HTML documents.  For more complex 
documents, HTML also has tags for several types of lists, extended quotes, 
character formatting, and other items.

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.1">Lists</A></H3>

HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and description lists.

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.1.1">Unnumbered Lists</A></H4>

To make an unnumbered list,

<OL>
    <LI>Start with an opening list <SAMP>&lt;UL&gt;</SAMP> tag.
    <LI>Enter the <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> tag followed by the individual item. 
    (No closing <SAMP>&lt;/LI&gt;</SAMP> tag is needed.)
    <LI>End with a closing list <SAMP>&lt;/UL&gt;</SAMP> tag.
</OL>

<P>
Below an example two-item list:

<PRE>
&lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;apples
    &lt;LI&gt;bananas
&lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The output is

<UL>
    <LI>apples
    <LI>bananas
</UL>

<P>
Different viewers display unordered lists differently.  A browser might use 
bullets, filled circles, or dashes to indicate the items.

<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> items can contain multiple paragraphs.  Just 
separate the paragraphs with the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph tags.

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.1.2">Numbered Lists</A></H4>

A numbered list (also called an ordered list, from where the abbreviation

rather than the <SAMP>&lt;UL&gt;</SAMP> directive. The items are tagged

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.1.3">Description Lists </A></H4>

A description list usually consists of alternating a description title 
(abbreviated as <SAMP>DT</SAMP>) and a description (abbreviated as 
<SAMP>DD</SAMP>).  Web browsers generally format the description on a new 
line.

<P>
The following is an example description list:

<PRE>
&lt;DL&gt;
    &lt;DT&gt;NCSA
    &lt;DD&gt;NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, 
        is located on the campus of the University of Illinois at 
        Urbana-Champaign. NCSA is a one of the participating institutions 
        in the National MetaCenter for Computational Science and Engineering.
    &lt;DT&gt;Cornell Theory Center 
    &lt;DD&gt;CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in 
        Ithaca, New York. CTC is another participant in the National 
        MetaCenter for Computational Science and Engineering. 
&lt;/DL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The output looks like:

<DL COMPACT>
    <DT>NCSA
    <DD>NCSA is located on the campus of the University of Illinois at 
    Urbana-Champaign. NCSA is a one of the participants in the National

    <DD>CTC is located on the campus of Cornell 
    University in Ithaca, New York. CTC is another participant in the National 
    MetaCenter for Computational Science and Engineering.
</DL>

<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;DT&gt;</SAMP> and<SAMP> &lt;DD&gt;</SAMP> entries can contain 
multiple paragraphs (separated by <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph tags), 
lists, or other description information.

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.1.4">Nested Lists</A></H4>

Lists can be arbitrarily nested, although in practice you probably should 
limit the nesting to three levels.  You can also have a number of 
paragraphs, each containing a nested list, in a single list item, and so 
on.

<P>
The display of an unnumbered list varies with the browser.  A browser may 
not provide successive levels of indentation or modify the bullets used at 
each level.

<P>
An example nested list:

<PRE>
&lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; A few New England states:        
        &lt;UL&gt;
             &lt;LI&gt; Vermont
             &lt;LI&gt; New Hampshire
        &lt;/UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;One Midwestern state:        
        &lt;UL&gt;
             &lt;LI&gt; Michigan
        &lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The nested list is displayed as

<UL>
    <LI>A few New England states:
    
    <UL>
	<LI>Vermont
	<LI>New Hampshire
    </UL>
    
    <LI>One Midwestern state:
    
    <UL>
	<LI>Michigan
    </UL>
    
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.2">Preformatted Text</A></H3>

Use the<SAMP> &lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> tag (which stands for ``preformatted'') to 
include text in a fixed-width font and to cause spaces, new lines, and tabs 
to be significant. This is useful for program listings.  For example, the 
following lines

<PRE>
&lt;PRE&gt;
#!/bin/csh 
cd $SCR
cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f
cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile 
fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f mya.out                                   
cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile      
rm *                                    
&lt;/PRE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
display as

<PRE>
#!/bin/csh 
cd $SCR
cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f
cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile 
fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f mya.out                                   
cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile      
rm *                                    
</PRE>

<P>
Hypertext references can be used within <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> sections.  
You should avoid using other HTML tags within 
<SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP>sections, however, because the formatting will 
differ from browser to browser.

<P>
Note that because &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you 
have to use their escape sequences (&amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;amp;, 
respectively) to enter these characters.  See the section on special 
characters below.

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.3">Extended Quotes</A></H3>

Use the <SAMP>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</SAMP> tag to include quotations in a 
separate block on the screen. The formatted text is generally indented to 
separate it from surrounding text.

<P>
An example:

<PRE>
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply 
rooted in the American dream. &lt;P&gt; 
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and
live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths 
to be self-evident that all men are created equal. &lt;P&gt; 
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The result is

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

<P>
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true 
meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men 
are created equal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.4">Addresses</A></H3>

The <SAMP>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</SAMP> tag is generally used within HTML 
documents to specify the author of a document and provides a means of 
contacting the author (e.g., an email address). This is usually the last 
item in a file and generally starts on a new line.

<P>
For example, the last line of the online version of this primer is

<PRE>
&lt;ADDRESS&gt;A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu &lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The result is <BR><BR>

<ADDRESS>A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu </ADDRESS>

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.5">Character Formatting</A></H3>

Individual words or sentences can be put in special styles. There are two 
types of styles: logical and physical. <DFN>Logical styles</DFN>tag text 
according to its meaning, while <DFN>physical styles</DFN>specify the 
specific appearance of a section. For example, in the preceding sentence, 
the words ``logical styles'' was tagged as a ``definition.''  The same 
effect (formatting those words in italics), could have been achieved via a 
different tag that specifies merely ``put these words in italics.''

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.5.1">Use logical tags when possible</A></H4>

If physical tags and logical tags produce the same result on the screen, 
why are there both? We devolve, for a couple of paragraphs, into the 
philosophy of SGML, which can be summed in a Zen-like mantra: ``Trust your 
browser.''

<P>
In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation.  Thus, 
SGML tags a level one heading as a level one heading, but does not specify 
that the level one heading should be, for instance, 24-point bold Times 
centered on the top of a page. The advantage of this approach (it's similar 
in concept to style sheets in many word processors) is that if you decide 
to change level one headings to be 20-point left-justified Helvetica, all 
you have to do is change the definition of the level one heading in the 
presentation device (i.e., the World Wide Web browser).

<P>
The other advantage of logical tags is that it helps enforce consistency in 
your documents. It's easier to tag something as <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> 
than to remember that level one headings are 24 point bold Times or 
whatever. The same is true for character styles. For example, consider the 
<SAMP>&lt;STRONG&gt;</SAMP> tag. Most browsers render it in bold text. 
However, it is possible that someone would prefer that these sections be 
rendered in red instead. Logical styles offer this flexibility.

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.5.2">Using character tags</A></H4>

</DL>

<P>
Some browsers support nested character format tags (for example, using 
<SAMP>&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;</SAMP> to indicate 
bold-italic text).  Other browsers, however, use only the innermost tag 
(here, <SAMP>&lt;I&gt;</SAMP>) to determine the formatting. It is 
recommended that you do not nest character format tags.

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.6">Special Characters</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.6.1">Escape sequences</A></H4>

Three characters of the ASCII character set  --  the left angle 
bracket(&lt;), the right angle bracket (&gt;), the ampersand (&amp;) and 
the double quote(&quot;)  --  have special meaning within HTML and 
therefore cannot be used ``as is.'' (The angle brackets are used to 
indicate the beginning and end of HTML tags, and the ampersand is used to 
indicate the beginning of an escape sequence.)

<P>
To use one of these characters in an HTML document, you must enter its 
<DFN>escape </DFN><DFN>sequence</DFN> instead:

<DL COMPACT>
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;lt;</SAMP> <DD>the escape sequence for &lt;
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;gt;</SAMP><DD>the escape sequence for &gt;
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;amp;</SAMP><DD>the escape sequence for &amp;
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;quot;</SAMP><DD>the escape sequence for &quot;
</DL>

<P>
There are additional escape sequences to support accented characters.For 
example:

<DL COMPACT>
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;ouml;</SAMP><DD>the escape sequence for a lowercase o with 
    an umlaut: &otilde;
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;ntilde;</SAMP><DD>the escape sequence for a lowercase n with 
    an tilde: &ntilde;
    <DT><SAMP>&amp;Egrave;</SAMP><DD>the escape sequence for an uppercase E 
    with a grave mark: &Egrave;
</DL>

<P>
Many such escapes exist and are available in a listing from CERN.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Unlike the rest of HTML, the escape sequences are 
case sensitive. You cannot, for instance, use &amp;LT; instead of &amp;lt;.

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.6.2">Forced line breaks</A></H4>

The <SAMP>&lt;BR&gt;</SAMP> tag forces a line break. (By contrast,most 
browsers format the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph tag with an additional 
blank line in order to indicate the beginning the new paragraph more 
clearly.)

<P>
One use of <SAMP>&lt;BR&gt;</SAMP> is in formatting addresses:

<PRE>
National Center for Supercomputing Applications&lt;BR&gt;    
605 East Springfield Avenue&lt;BR&gt;
Champaign, Illinois 61820-5518 &lt;BR&gt;
</PRE>

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.6.3">Horizontal rules</A></H4>

The <SAMP>&lt;HR&gt; tag </SAMP>produces a horizontal line the width of the 
browser window.

<H3><A NAME="A1.4.7">Inline Images</A></H3>

NCSA Mosaic can display X Bitmap (XBM) or GIF format images within HTML 
documents.  Each image takes time to process and slows down the initial 
display of the document.  Using a particular image multiple times in a 
document causes very little performance degradation compared to using the 
image only once.

<P>
To include an inline image in your document, use

<PRE>
&lt;IMG SRC=<VAR>image_URL</VAR>&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>image_URL</VAR> is the URL of the image file. The syntax 
for<SAMP>IMG SRC </SAMP>URLs is identical to that used in anchors. If the 
image file is a GIF file, then the file name part of 
<VAR>image_URL</VAR><STRONG>must</STRONG> end with <SAMP>.gif</SAMP>. 
Similarly,file names of X Bitmap images must end with <SAMP>.xbm</SAMP>.

<P>
<IMG SRC = "Graphics/RandomPic.gif" ALT = "">
By default the bottom of an image is aligned with the text as shown in this paragraph.

<P>
<IMG SRC = "Graphics/RandomPic.gif" ALT = "" ALIGN=TOP>  
Use the <SAMP>ALIGN=TOP</SAMP> parameter if you want the browser to align adjacent 
text with the top of the image as shown in this paragraph. The full inline 
image tag with the top alignment is:

<PRE>
&lt;IMG ALIGN=top SRC=<VAR>image_URL</VAR>&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<IMG SRC = "Graphics/RandomPic.gif" ALT = "" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
<SAMP>ALIGN=MIDDLE</SAMP> aligns the text with the center of the image.

<H4><A NAME="A1.4.7.1">Alternate text for viewers that can't display 
images</A></H4>

Some World Wide Web browsers, namely those that run on VT100 terminals, 
cannot display images. However, often there is suitable text to replace the 
image. The <SAMP>ALT</SAMP> modifier tag allows you to specify text to be 
displayed when an image cannot be displayed. For example,

<PRE>
&lt;IMG SRC = &quot;UpArrow.gif&quot; ALT=&quot;Up&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
where <SAMP>UpArrow.gif </SAMP>is the picture of an upward pointing arrow. 
With NCSA Mosaic and other graphics-capable viewers, the user sees the up 
arrow graphic.  With a VT100 browser, such as lynx, the user sees the word 
``Up.''

<H2><A NAME="A1.5">External Images, Sounds, and Animations</A></H2>

You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a user 
activates a link on either a word or a smaller version of the image that 
you have inlined into your document.  This is considered an external image 
and is useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of the main 
document.  Even if you include a small version of the image in your 
document as the link to the larger image, the processing time for the 
``postage stamp'' image is much less than for the full image.

<P>
To include a reference to a graphic in an external document, use

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF = <VAR>image_URL</VAR>&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The exact same syntax is used for links to external animations and sounds. 
For example,

<P>
<SAMP>&lt;A HREF = &quot;QuickTimeMovie.mov&quot;&gt;link 
anchor&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP>

<P>
specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. In fact, the only difference is the 
file extension of the linked file. Some common file types and their 
extensions are

<DL COMPACT>
    <DT><STRONG>File type</STRONG><DD><STRONG>Extension</STRONG>
    <DT>Plain text<DD><SAMP>.txt</SAMP>
    <DT>HTML document<DD><SAMP>.html</SAMP>
    <DT>GIF image<DD><SAMP>.gif</SAMP>
    <DT>TIFF image<DD><SAMP>.tiff</SAMP>
    <DT>XBM bitmap image<DD><SAMP>.xbm</SAMP>
    <DT>JPEG image<DD><SAMP>.jpg</SAMP> or <SAMP>.jpeg</SAMP>
    <DT>PostScript file<DD><SAMP>.ps</SAMP>
    <DT>AIFF sound<DD><SAMP>.aiff</SAMP>
    <DT>AU sound<DD><SAMP>.au</SAMP>
    <DT>QuickTime movie<DD><SAMP>.mov</SAMP>
    <DT>MPEG movie<DD><SAMP>.mpeg</SAMP> or <SAMP>.mpg</SAMP>
</DL>

<P>
Make sure your intended audience has the necessary viewers.  Most UNIX 
workstations, for instance, are not able to view QuickTime movies.

<H2><A NAME="A1.6">Troubleshooting</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="A1.6.1">Avoid Overlapping Tags</A></H3>

Consider this snippet of HTML:

<PRE>
&lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;DFN&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt;HTML tags.&lt;/DFN&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The word ``overlapping'' is contained within both the 
<SAMP>&lt;B&gt;</SAMP>and <SAMP>&lt;DFN&gt;</SAMP> tags.  How will the 
browser format it?You won't know until you look, and different browsers 
will likely react differently to this construct. In general, avoid 
overlapping tags.

<H3><A NAME="A1.6.2">Embed Anchors and Character Formats, But Avoid 
Embedding Anything Else</A></H3>

It is acceptable to embed anchors within another HTML element:

<PRE>
&lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Do not</STRONG> embed a heading or another HTML element within an 
anchor:

<PRE>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt; &lt;H1&gt;My heading&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Although most browsers will currently handle this, it is forbidden by the 
official HTML and HTML+ specifications, and it will not work with future 
browsers.

<P>
Character formatting tags are used to modify the appearance of other tags:

<PRE>
&lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;B&gt;
        
&lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/I&gt;

&lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
However, avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags.  For example,it 
is tempting to embed a heading within a list, in order to make the font 
size larger:

<PRE>
&lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading&lt;/H1&gt;        

&lt;UL&gt; 
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt;

&lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Although some browsers, such as NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System,format 
this quite nicely, it is unpredictable (because it is undefined) how other 
browsers will handle it. For compatibility with all browsers,avoid these 
kind of constructs.

<P>
What's the difference? This is again a question of SGML. The semantic 
meaning of <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> is that it's the main heading of a 
document and that it should be followed by the content of the document.A 
browser that formats<SAMP> &lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> as centered text on the page 
is likely to get confused if it finds that tag within a list.

<P>
Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. You might expect 
that

<PRE>
&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
would produce bold italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers 
interpret only the innermost tag (here, the italics).

<H3><A NAME="A1.6.3">Check your links</A></H3>

In NCSA Mosaic, when an <SAMP>&lt;IMG&gt;</SAMP> tag points at an image 
that does not exist or cannot be otherwise obtained from whatever server is 
supposed to be serving it, a dummy image is substituted. For example, 
entering <SAMP>&lt;IMG 
HREF=&quot;DoesNotEx</SAMP><SAMP>ist.gif&quot;&gt;</SAMP>(where 
<SAMP>DoesNotExist.gif</SAMP> is a nonexistent file) causes the following 
to be displayed: <BR>
<IMG SRC = "Graphics/DoesNotExist.pict" ALT = ""><BR>

<P>
If this happens, first make sure that the referenced image does in fact 
exist, that the hyperlink has the correct information in the link entry, 
and that the file permission is set appropriately (world-readable).

<H2><A NAME="A1.7">A Longer Example</A></H2>

Here is a longer example of an HTML document:

<PRE>
&lt;TITLE&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;    
&lt;H1&gt;A Longer Example&lt;/H1&gt;

This is a simple HTML document. This is the first    
paragraph. &lt;P&gt;
This is the second paragraph, which shows special effects.
This is a word in &lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;.
This is a word in &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;.  
Here is an inlined GIF image: 
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;myimage.gif&quot;&gt;. &lt;P&gt;    

This is the third paragraph, which demonstrates links.  
Here is a hypertext link from the word 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;subdir/myfile.html&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/A&gt;
to a document called &quot;subdir/myfile.html&quot;. 
(If you try to follow this link, you will get an error screen.) &lt;P&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;A second-level header&lt;/H2&gt;
Here is a section of text that should 
display as a fixed-width font: &lt;P&gt;    

&lt;PRE&gt;
On the stiff twig up there       
Hunches a wet black rook
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain ...
&lt;/PRE&gt;

This is a unordered list with two items: &lt;P&gt;

&lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; cranberries
    &lt;LI&gt; blueberries
&lt;/UL&gt;

This is the end of my example document. &lt;P&gt;
