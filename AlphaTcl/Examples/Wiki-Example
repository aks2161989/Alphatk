   1. You can refer to another page by putting its name in square 
brackets like this: [[PAGE]]
   1. URLs will automatically be recognized and underlined: 
http://your.site/contents.html
   1. If you put URLs in square brackets, they'll be shown as a tiny 
reference [http://your.site/contents.html] instead.(''In this  
situation,the system assumes that any url ending in '''.jpg, .png, or 
.gif''' is an image and displays it inline.'')
   1. '''URL ''methods'' recognized are:'''
      * http://www.w3.org/
      * ftp://ftp.x.org/
      * mailto:user@somehost.com

Test quotes pathologically (There are evidently some '''significant''' 
differences between one wiki and another?):

P '' I ''' BI '' B ''' P ''' B '' BI ''' B '' P

'one quote'
''two quotes''
'''three quotes'''
''''four quotes''''
'''''five quotes'''''
''''''six quotes''''''
'''''''seven quotes'''''''

''''''''eight quotes; a dollar!''''''''
'''All for Tcl--Stand up and holler!'''
