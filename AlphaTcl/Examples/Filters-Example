# Filters Tutorial
==================

This is a tutorial that demonstrates the "Filters" menu.  

In order to use it, you must first activate the menu by going to the menu
item "Config --> Preferences --> Menus" and selecting 'Filters Menu' by
checking the corresponding checkbox.

The Filters Menu allows you to do successive "Search And Replace" operations.
All the operations are gathered in files called << filters >> which you can 
apply to any text file opened in Alpha.

This Tutorial, when opened through a hyperlink, is a "shell" window.  None
of the changes you make will affect the actual file.  If you close the
window and then click on the hyperlink again, you will start with the same
example as before.  Note that "Undo" is not available in shell windows.

This tutorial is in Setx mode to take advantage of some file marking and
colorizing procedures.  The Filters menu can work in any mode.


# Filter Examples
=================


# First example
---------------

Suppose your file is full of accented letters and you want to strip all the
accents (to send an e-mail for instance).  You can select the filter called
"Strip The Accents".  Once it is selected, you will see its name at the
bottom of the Filters menu.  Bring your current file's window to the front
and choose the "Apply to file" menu item.

Alternatively you can use the following key binding: hit control-f,
release, then hit the f key.  If you convert only a selected region, hit
control-f, release, then hit the s key.  To pick a filter you can also use
control-f p.

Experiment with the following sample, full of accented letters (this a 
french poem by Apollinaire.  We want accented letters, don't we) :

    S'Žtendant sur les c™tŽs du cimetire 
    La maison des morts l'encadrait comme un clo”tre 
    Ë l'intŽrieur de ses vitrines 
    Pareilles ˆ celles des boutiques de modes 
    Au lieu de rire debout 
    Les mannequins grimaaient pour l'ŽternitŽ.


# Second example
----------------

Suppose no filter suits your needs.  You'll have to write your own.  This
is very easy.  Choose the "New Filter" menu item in the "Filters Utilities"
submenu.  You'll be prompted for a name to give to the new filter.  Let's
call it "MyNewFilter": this new filter is now the active filter.

Suppose you want to change in a text all the occurences of J.S. Bach in L.
van Beethoven, then to delete all the occurences of the ¤ character and
finally to replace multiple tabulations by a single one.  You have to type
the three following lines (more about the filters syntax later) where the
arguments are tab-separated:

J.S. Bach	L. van Beethoven
¤
\t+	\t	1

Save your filter and apply it as in the preceding example.  You can check the
syntax of your new filter thanks to the "Check Syntax" menu item in the
Filters Utilities submenu (or hit control-f c).

Experiment on the following example :

    Works by J.S. Bach :
    ¤		for organ
    ¤		for cello


# Third example 
---------------

Suppose you want to apply several filters successively: for instance "Html
To Accents" then "Accents To Rtf".  This can be done in one run thanks to the
MultiFilter.  The MultiFilter will be the list of filters you want to apply
(in the order you want them to be applied).  To build such a list, hold the
option key down then open the Filters menu: instead of "Pick a filter" its
first item will now be "Build a multifilter" which brings a list of all the
filters available.  This list will be brought to you repeatedly until you
have chosen all the filters you want and have finished with the "cancel"
button.  To apply the Multifilter to a selection, a file or a folder, hold
down the option key and select the corresponding item in the Filters menu.
 
To experiment, take the follawing example containing a series of accented
letters a la LaTex, and build a multifilter with the "Latex To Accents"
filter followed by the "Strip The Accents" filter :

    \`{a}\`{u}\'{e}\`{e}\^{o}\^{\i}\^{e}\^{a}


# Fourth example
----------------

If you want to do temporary conversions on the fly and do not want to keep
them in a filter, you have the Temporary Filter.  You use it exactly like
any other filter.  The only difference is that the instructions you write
in it will not be saved.  They will remain only as long as you do not quit
Alpha and do not close it.

Exercise : in the present file, replace all the occurences of the isolated
word filter by FILTER and all the double quotes by single quotes.

Solution : open a temporary filter and type the following two lines :

filter	FILTER	1im
"	'

Then save and choose the 'Apply Temp To File' menu item.


# More examples
---------------

Choose the menu item "Filters --> Filter Utilities --> Edit A Filter" and
choose the filter named 'Example'.  Most of the filters provided with the
Filters Menu deal with accents conversions but you can imagine many kinds
of conversions.

A more advanced example is given in the "Convert Html To Latex" filter
which effectively converts an Html document to a latex source file ready to
process with LaTeX.

Experiment with the following example :

    <HTML>
    <HEAD>
       <TITLE>THE ALPHA TEXT EDITOR</TITLE>
       <META NAME=GENERATOR CONTENT="Claris Home Page 1.0">
       <X-SAS-WINDOW TOP=42 BOTTOM=757 LEFT=4 RIGHT=534>
    </HEAD>
    <BODY>
    <H3>WELCOME TO ALPHA</H3>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <H4>Introduction</H4>
    <P>Alpha is a<I> very powerful, </I>multi-purpose text editor. Alpha
    is <I>multi-modal,</I> which means it switches between different
    modes depending on which type of document you are editing.</P>
    <H4>Tutorial</H4>
    <P>Here is a list of various modes available in Alpha :</P>
    <UL>
       <LI>tcl
       <LI>html
       <LI>tex
       <LI>java
       <LI>perl

# Filters Key Bindings
======================


There are a few easy to remember keybindings "ˆ la emacs".  For all of them
you have to hit 'ctrl-f', release, then hit one of the following letters:

	-  p  to <p>ick a filter
	-  s  to filter the <s>election
	-  f  to filter the current <f>ile
	-  d  to filter a fol<d>er (or <d>irectory)
	-  e  to <e>dit a filter
	-  n  to create a <n>ew filter
	-  t  to call up the <t>emporary filter
	-  c  to <c>heck the syntax
	-  m  to build a <m>ultifilter
   
Now if you add the shift key with letters s, f, d, e you get the equivalent
actions but with Multifilter instead of Filter.  For instance 'ctrl-f
shift-f' is equivalent to "apply multifilter to the current file" and
'ctrl-f shift-c' will clear the multifilter.  

There are three more key bindings to use the Temporary Filter.  First hit
'ctrl-t', release, then hit one of the letters s, f, d to apply the
temporary filter to a <s>election, to the current <f>ile or to a
<d>irectory repectively.
