= AlphaTcl change log					
================================================================================ 
 
Fixes and improvements of 7.x and 8.x versions of AlphaTcl carried out
through an open source process based around the 'AlphaTcl' project on
sourceforge, and the alphatcl-developers mailing list.  Note that while the
AlphaTcl library is free, Alpha and Alphatk are not; please register with the
respective author.

All of the fixes and changes below were provided by the Alpha user and developer
community.  If there's something you don't like about Alpha, feel free to try to
change/fix it.  In particular, Jon Guyer, Daniel Steffen, Vince Darley, Johan
Linde, Mark Nagata, Tom Fetherston, Dominique d'Humieres, Frédéric Boulanger,
Chuck Gregory, Pierre Basso, Juan Falgueras, Andreas Amann, Craig Upright,
Andreas Fischlin, Donavan Hall, Bernard Desgraupes, Lars Hellström, Joachim Kock
deserve particular mention for their code contributions and fixes to the
AlphaTcl library and its associated documentation.  AlphaTcl and all its
standard modes, menus and packages contain some 170000 lines of code!

This AlphaTcl 8 library works with any of Alpha 8, Alpha X or Alphatk.
Changes to these are listed in the help files "Changes - Alpha", or
"Changes - Alphatk" respectively.

= 8.1a1 released                           last update: 09/27/2005 {01:41:55 PM}
================================================================================
• we only support Alphatk 8.3.3 or newer, or Alpha 8/X 8.0b17 or newer.
• supersearch now respects 'wrap' setting in "Replace All". (bug 1679)
• supersearch bug fix to 'in selection' "Replace & Find Again". (bug 1682)
• 'typeText' now does what it says -- types the text character by character.
  (bug 1668)
• activate xserv helpers menu item by default.  The old menu item will
  be phased out soon.
• removed vestiges of Alpha 8/X's non-functional 'soft wrap'.  If/when 
  this is supported by Alpha 8/X (as it is in Alphatk), we can easily
  add it back.  Right now this code simply gets in the way.
• 'Shel' no longer features as a real mode.  Its functionality is all
  possible with the composite mode/minor mode stuff.  Removed the
  'Experimental Tcl Shell' package, and replaced the old Tcl Shell with
  the new version.  This means the Tcl shell is now actually in Tcl 
  mode, just with various Shel bindings/colouring/hooks attached.
• better indentation for xml mode. (bug 1675)
• no longer empty hook,var,featuremodes lists
• added 'win::adjustInfo' for lappend/linsert/lreplace etc, operations
  on window attributes.  Made some hooks use hook::callForWin
• "Utils > Spellcheck Selection" creates, inserts temp file contents. (bug 1299)
• 'win::setInfo' can now take multiple attribute-value pairs.
• added support for 'dict with' and 'dict update' to the Tcl 8.4 'dict' 
  emulation.
• better handling of window attributes when changing a window's mode.
• use Xserv in diff mode by default
• moved 'dosc' to BackCompatibility.tcl
• better url::getBrowserUrlAndName implementation for Windows.
• moved 'eventHandler' to BackCompatibility.tcl
• removed obsolete tkdiffControl.tcl and obsolete Diff-Handlers 
  preference from Diff mode.  This is handled by xserv.
• removed DiffSig -- no longer used.
• removed lots of obsolete workarounds from AlphaTcl.  Bugs in 
  Alpha8/X/tk have been fixed.
• clarified documentation of preCloseHook, closeHook, and cleaned up
  suspendHook and resumeHook which do not pass any arguments.
• removed 'win::_stackorder' handling -- all this is handled by Alpha 8/X/tk's 
  core in [winNames -f].  Simplified windows.tcl and alphaHooks.tcl.  The
  proc: win::StackOrder is now defined as the same as [winNames -f].
• removed over-rides of tclLog.  Added 'alpha::stdout', 'alpha::stderr' and
  alpha::log (stdout|stderr) msg.
• xml mode uses per-window colouring with 'colortags' now, and per-window 
  completions.
• major update to the package: mailMenu, including the ability to read/post
  e-mails from within Alpha using the "pop3" "mime" and "smtp" packages.
  See the new "Tcl/Menus/Mail Menu/Changes - Mail Menu" file for details.
• the [global::listPackages] proc includes package descriptions in Help window.
• the string «ALPHA» is converted to $:alpha::application in 'help/description'
  text strings by various procedures.
• status message to track slow [::alphaServer::start] during launch. (bug 1726)
• completed separation of Tcl shells from the Shel functionality which is now
  totally agnostic of what it is being used for.
• new [file::setType] procedure, companion to [file::setSig].
• new [file::toAlphaSigType] procedure to set file to Alpha's sig, type.
• all of Ada, Bib, C, C++, Caml, Chng, Fort, GPLT, HTML, Igor, Lisp, Objc, Pyth,
  S, SAS, Scil, Scm, Scrp, sh, SPSS, SQL, Stta, TeX, Text, TIP
  [<mode>::MarkFile] take the optional -w <win> argument.  Many other modes
  still need to be updated.  (The modes Mail, Setx, and Tcl already took them.)
• improved menu dimming and window behaviour with hidden/minimized windows.
• [win::searchAndHyperise] and [help::colour...] procs take optional "-w <win>".
• unique menu names for "Frontier Menu > (Open|Browse) Frontier".
• enhanced "AlphaDev > Alpha Testing" menu presentation, display windows.
• significant overhaul of the mode-changing process, including the addition of
  a number of new tests (modesPackages.test) to fix a variety of subtle bugs
  in the treatment of conflicts between mode and global variables with the
  same name.
• renamed changeMode to alpha::changeMode to clarify that it is private to 
  alphaHooks.tcl.  Removed all external uses of it.
• new "bugzillaHomePage" global variable defined in "alphaDefinitions.tcl".
• better [help::openPrefsDialog] handling of global preference pane strings.
• removed [alpha::menuAdjustForOpenWins] usage from various modes/features.
• fixes to minor mode implementation.  Now Calc and Dico are not longer real
  global modes.  Further overhaul of the core mode-changing functionality
  in alphaHooks.tcl and documentation in "Extending Alpha".
• all modes except C# now take '-w <win>' for their <mode>::MarkFile proc.
• new 'Include Hidden Files In Built In Filesets' flag in the filesets menu 
  which affects the contents of the 'Top Window's Directory', 'Top Window's 
  Hierarchy' and 'Recurse In...' procedural filesets.
• C# mode also takes '-w <win>' for its MarkFile proc, and fixed Inst 
  mode's -w <win> handling
• major update to the Alpha's internal calculator.
• [correction::correctTypo] uses the window's "wordBreak" values.  (bug 1767)
• CM Clipboard "Insert/Move Selection" use [::cut] and [::paste].  (RFE 1763)
• "Mail" mode no longer exists.  All Mail windows open in Text mode, using
  minor-mode technology.  (See "mailWindows.tcl").  Reset "hardcodedCounter".
• cleaned up "Examples Help" to reflect recent mode deletions.
• all [<mode>::correctIndentation] procs take -w <win>.
• all [<mode>::getLimits] procs take -w <win>.
• The procs [::indentRegion] [::bind::IndentLine] and [::indentLine] all accept
  optional "-w <win>" arguments, but only call mode procs with them if <win> is
  not [win::Current].
• checked in first broad usage of 'xserv' code for inter-application 
  communication: running latex, viewing dvi, pdf, urls, spellchecking
  documents, etc.
• added 'EE' menu which, for example, helps with development of .dtx documents.
• increased usa of xserv.  Removed old helper applications dialog completely. 
  Main remaining coding is to replace all users of browserSig with xserv calls.
• Alpha/AlphaTcl electrics are now defined entirely by the AlphaDev Menu.
• Tcl and AlphaDev CM modules updated.
• Fort mode update; new "f90" mode for free-format Fortran files.
• added Joachim's 'console attributes' code to CorePackages.
• dictionary 2.3.3: uses console attributes, and supports other encodings 
• Brws mode allows batch find windows to be saved and re-opened and still
  function correctly.
• New "XML > Xml Editing > Balance Tags" menu command.
• added conditional support for '-geometryvariable' to various dialog
  commands to avoid 'jumping dialog' problems. (Alphatk only at present)
• various xServ updates, reversions, still in transition to version 2.0 .
• more "Help > Report A Bug" options in initial dialog, to begin a stack trace
  and to attach a file to an existing bug report. (part of bug 1851)
• restored ability to make Tcl Menu shortcuts globally active.
• the package: copyRing inserts a new "Edit > Swap Clipboard" command.
• 'typeset' xserv.  Implementations: TeXShop, iTeXMac, OzTeX, tetexComm and
  helperApps.  (The last one is equal to the previous state of affairs.)
• tetexComm has gone mainstream: can be invoked through Cmd-T or the TeX 
  menu, respects helper settings for viewers.  Many other improvements -- 
  see the tetexComm.tcl file for more details.
• altComm namespace no longer exists, is now tetexComm.  Please update your 
  prefs file, some prefvars are obsolete.  See tetexComm.tcl for details.
• tetexComm xserv implementations of bibtex and makeindex
• Alpha Tcl Shell remembers win attributes (e.g. geometry and fontsize)
• diffMode reform initiated.  Numerous minor fixes and simplifications:
  [compare::directories] works again; Diff and Compare drivers made more 
  robust; initial arrow-up fixed (Bug 1890); closes object windows when
  supposed to; avoid scanning every diff window twice; added documentation;
  .DS_Store file skipping (Bug 1512); flags do not interfere with file names 
  (Bug 1895); better handling of paths with spaces (Bug 1894); more graceful 
  error handling when patching.
• added Compare Selections.
• temporary files mechanism (used by typesetSelection and compare::selections)
• temporary geometries mechanism (avoid remembering programmatically resized
  window positions).  Used by DiffMode and by BrowserMode.
• [cvs::actionOn(File|Dir)] calls helper in background (bug 1801)
• new "variable: <varName>" hyperlink available in help files.  
• cleaned up [TeX::Completion::Env] for better flow.
• new [TeX::addNewEnvironment] procedure for user-defined environments.
• new [TeX::newEnvironmentHelp] procedure to create explanatory help window.
• new "TeX Menu > Environments > Add New Environment" menu item.  
  (Creating simplified methods for user-modifications is on the to-do list.)
• cleaned up the temporary files mechanism, avoiding proliferation of global
  variable entanglements across AlphaTcl.  
• added [file::readWinBoundsFromResource] and [file::writeWinBoundsInResource]
• diffMode reform, phase 2.  Numerous minor fixes and clean-up.  
  The buggy global variable $diffDir has been replaced by a win attribute 
  "difftype": this confines Bug 1907 to the case of foreign diff files.  
  Workaround for quote-versus-brace problem reported in RFE 1888.
  Dim the RerunDiff menu item when appropriate.
• [editWithTemporaryGeometry] becomes [openWithTemporaryGeometry] (with more 
  precise specifications)
• [findViaFileMarks] accepts optional window, position; returns found mark name.

  to a nice new version.
• added TeXniscope to list of view-dvi helpers in TeX mode
• use proper password edit field in Report A Bug.

  (only for Alphatk -- see "initAlphaTcl.tcl" and bug 1642.)
• fixed a number of preferences callback scripts which assumed they
  would not be passed an argument
• cleaned up a lot of the prefs:: handling, and renamed flag:: procs to 
  prefs:: namespace (with backwards compatibility).  All variables in
  the prefs:: namespace should be considered private to prefsHandling.tcl
  (this required changing a few modes and packages)
• moved incrementalSearch menu items into that package, and made it
  always-on (now that it has an init-script, that is needed).

• extended MacShell capacities with new commands and support for Unix non 
  interactive bin tools
• alphaServer improvements: changed protocol, clients can wait for window 
  closing. Better behavior when server is off (thanks Frédéric)
• alphac accepts a -wait option allowing to wait until last edited window 
  is closed. One can now use AlphaX as system editor for crontab et al.
• "reportABug.tcl" includes a new [makeASuggestion] routine, and "help.tcl" has
  support for this and "Search E-mail Archives". (RFE 1228)
• correct usage of "filesetmodeVars(includeNonTextFiles)" variable (bug 1241)
• modified SourceForge Menu to reflect new Tracker system.
• "Use Kpsewhich" option for listing Bib mode files. (thanks Joachim) (RFE 1260)

• new "AlphaDev Menu > Alpha Testing > Create Test Suite File" menu item.
• added "type" and "creator" to Format pop-up menu. (RFE 1225)
• new "AlphaDev Menu > Help File Marking > Convert To Setext" menu item.
• documented optional 'number' argument to lookAt.
• updated Terminal package from Lars.
• added "printing.tcl" to AlphaTcl.  Contribution from Alphatk's codebase.  We 
  can build on this to provide printing in Alpha X.
• "File Utils" package renamed "Window Utilities", with major update.
• new "File Compression" core package, with archiving API.
• fixed + documented menu::replaceWith and menu::insert, allowing the
  ability to insert _after_ a given menu item.
• renamed 'Shell' to 'Tcl Shell' in Utils menu, as per discussion in alpha-d, 
  which involved changes to a number of packages.  Also removed 
  'Toolserver Shell' from Shell mode and Utils menu (it can be accessed from 
  mpw mode).
• fixes to Wiki saving code.  Should work on Tcler's wiki now.
• added first cut proc: dndWinHook to alphaHooks.tcl
• added 'alpha::library' which implements an auto-loading, always-on feature.
  These packages cannot have preinit scripts (since AlphaTcl reserves the use 
  of that entry for its own purposes).
• better handling of 'recent searches' in supersearch dialog.
• new "Tcl Menu > Tcl-tk Shells" submenu, which incorporates code from the
  packages "Tkcon" and "Remote Tcl Shell" (now removed).
• new "Utils > Compare > Diff Prefs" menu item to change prefs before diffing.
• clarified the documentation of moveWin, sizeWin and getGeometry.

• [cut/copy] in "coreFixes.tcl" now accept ?-w win? (bug 1286)
• "Fileset Information" features are now [alpha::library] packages. (RFE 1289)
• "Tk Prefs" features are now [alpha::library] packages. (RFE 1290)
• added 'geometry' pref type.
• new url::getBrowserUrlAndName proc in www.tcl. Seven browsers supported on OSX.
• new "Add a favorite…" dynamic item in Wiki menu to add manually a page to 
  the Favorites submenu.
• moved 'tags' to separate package, no longer always on.
• New, extensible 'window attributes/info' functionality added to windows.tcl, 
  and used extensively in alphaHooks.tcl.  This also automatically gives
  Alpha 8/X support for window-specific indentationAmount and 
  indentUsingSpacesOnly as used by some fileset packages.
• overhaul of win::Modified, win::Dirty (no longer needed) and alphaHooks.tcl, 
  cleaning lots of things up.  This was all made possible by the new
  alphatcl-window attributes functionality.
• new [alpha::listAlphaTclPackages] SystemCode procedure.
• removed various Alpha7-specific code from AlphaTclCore.  This includes the
  duplicate sourcing of initialize.tcl which is already done by Alpha 8/X/tk core.
• shrinkLeft and shrinkRight keep window width to the minimum of the current
  width and the tileWidth, which is better behaviour for large screens (bug 1095)
• corrected behaviour and documentation in "Unicode and Encodings Help" so
  that mode-specific encodings must be declared with 'defaultEncoding',
  _not_ 'encoding', which caused various problems.
• further rework of alphaHooks.tcl, making the win::Modes array totally
  private to AlphaTclCore (and largely to alphaHooks.tcl).  There are now,
  for Alphatk, only two places where AlphaTcl tells the core what mode to
  use for a window (winCreatedHook and winChangeMode), and these are set
  separately for the window's bindmode and colormode.
• removed $win::Current usage and replaced with [lindex $win::Active 0],
  and cleaned up/fixed various use-cases, simplifying alphaHooks.tcl
• added 'off' argument to alpha::declare, but not yet functionally integrated.
• Further cleanup of alphaHooks.tcl, adding support for the opening of
  windows which are not frontmost.  This can be tested with 'new ... -background',
  for example (but we need to decide where/how to place a non-frontmost window).
• added an 'uninstall' argument to most AlphaTcl packages, removing it from
  those that are defined as essential core packages.
• removed [alpha::package require AlphaTcl ...] and [package require Tcl ...]
  when it is obvious that the requirements are met for cvs source files.
• fixed various bugs in users of 'lremove' and changed implementation to
  the Tcl-standard one.
• provide stackable composite-mode support for hooks
• removed some 'eval list' uses.
• fixed some Shel mode list vs string problems with the history mechanism.
• added timing capabilities to AlphaTcl startup.
• provided stackable composite-mode support for features.  This means all
  five window attributes (colouring, binding, variables, features and hooks) 
  are all now stackable in principle.
• added support for TeXShop to TeX mode.
• fix to some prefs savings problems with variables in namespaces that
  no longer exist.
• fix bug in inserting from electric menu in C,C++ modes (thanks Alin)
• fix to prefs saving to ensure normalized variable names are always used.
• fix to dndDrop to leave a window in the background and properly outline 
  the text dropped onto it.
• Removed Think state support. Window state popup now has a single item 
  "Remember Window State" replacing the none/think/mpw trio.
• fix to determining the global var ALPHA (due to new [processes] command in 
  the core).
• ensure AlphaTcl's auto_path components are at the front of the path,
  since we want them to take precedence over any Tcl extensions which 
  might be loaded.
• don't define obsolete printing preferences on Alpha X/Alphatk, and
  remove them from the printing prefs dialog.
• fix to 'unfloat' with no arguments
• 'backup' fixes from Joachim -- thanks!
• fix to package index rebuilding and 'for ... menu' declarations
• fix to wordBreak definition in Perl mode.
• added Craig's cut/copy/paste and copyRing 2.0 implementations.  Would
  still like to find a way to make cutCopyPasteUtilities an ordinary
  package in the future.
• enhanced 'evaluate' in Tcl mode to imitate 'source' when appropriate.
• removed indent_amounts() array, since not really compatible with
  window-specific data.
• more robust handling of 'window geometry' preference, and in general
  any preference which has a callback for modifications.
• reworked so 'paste' returns a list of start-end indices (not yet
  clear whether this will work well for rectangular selection without
  further core improvements).
• removed 'the the' typos from help files.
• removed superceded geometry code from terminal package.
• made contextual windowPath menu use newer titlebar hooks (instead of
  the old-style ones which are obsolete).
• removed obsolete alpha::reportError, and reportErrors pref.
• added Alpha 8/X encoding workaround to smarterSource.
• further fix to package::onOrOff (bug 1340)
• fixed Dico bug, where it inadvertently created a feature called
  'localDictionariesMenu'.
• removed obsolete variable 'include descriptions in dialogs'
• added functionality to ensure only prefs registered with newPref
  are shown in dialogs (may need more work).
• supersearch fixes for backreferences in regexp patterns and the
  necessary single/multi-line manipulations that takes place.
• removed enterSearchString, enterReplaceString, performSearch from
  coreFixes/coreImplementations, since the versions in supersearch
  are the ones actually used.
• modified package activation so one-time init scripts are not
  cleared (info stored in package::initted()).
• made complex supersearch pref checkSpacesAround private.
• added package 'off' handling -- needs testing.
• fix to filename completion in the tclShell (bug 1342)
• fix to Perl mode electric braces/semicolon being always on (bug 1324)
• better handling of status-bar moving
• updated dictionary package (thanks)
• fixes to AlphaTcl bugs 1345 (newly introduced sf, wiki menu problem), 1349
  ('new -shell 1' messes up dirtiness calculation), 1350 (typo in prefs code).
• replaced a-zA-Z0-9 by \w in various modes' wordBreak definition, bug 939.
• removed large number of obsolete help scripts/files from "Help"
• redo of prefs dialogs (if dialog::OLD is set to zero), using Lars'
  much more robust code.
• added experimental 'overrideGeometry' check to Brws mode.  This means
  that if a window has this info set (win::setInfo $wn overrideGeometry 1),
  then Brws mode will neither resize the browse window nor any other
  window it opens.
• removed use of 'dialog::modifyModeFlags' hook (only ever used by
  GPLT), replacing in GPLT mode with other perfectly good mechanism.
• significant update to Joachim's 'tetexComm' new interface to TeX.
• fix to indentation when typing and wrapping text with certain
  preferences set (bug 1353,1354)
• fixes to tetexComm when TeX'ing a .dtx file
• updated dialogsNew.dtx (source of all new dialogs code, examples and
  documentation), and updated all derived files, including the pdf help.
• new prefs dialogs are now the default.
• better annotation of creating balloon help added to "Help Files Help".
• better [package::helpFile] parsing of balloon help vs help window.
• the package "cutCopyPasteUtilities" has been renamed "clipboardPreferences".
  This is now an [alpha::feature], not an [alpha::library] package, and it has
  to be turned on by the user using "Config > Global Setup > Features".
• Alpha8/X/tk version numbers in [reportABug] stripped of "-D5", e.g. so 
  that we don't have to add Bugzilla field values for private dev releases.
• window sidebar "Marks Menu" now dims inappropriate items when there are 
  no current marks in the active window.  If the number of marks > 100, then
  we only add an item named "Go To Named Mark…" for better navigation.
• "contextualMenu.tcl" no longer unsets preferences, but only pays attention
  to those defined via [newPref].  (It now uses [prefs::isRegistered].)
• recentDirs "File > Save A Copy In" menu transfers type/creator to new file.
• preliminary changes for "IBM" vs "DOS" in [getModeValuesAlpha].  Core changes
  might be required to display "DOS" in the status bar pop-up. (bug 1146)
• status bar pop-up includes "<font> <fontsize> …", calls [setFontTabs].
• "Remember Window State" option only offered for windows that exist as files.
• [text::color] and [text::hyper] now accept optional ?-w $w? arguments.
• new [Chng::DblClick] to quickly find procs mentioned in this file!
• new "wordBreak" preference for Chng mode to include ":" and "." within words.
• new "prefixString" preference for Chng mode "• " to make it easier to add 
  entries to this log.  (Use "Text > (Un)Comment Line".)
• added Help button to new prefs dialogs implementation
• made wordWrap a 'variable' rather than 'flag' pref (which it hasn't been
  for probably 10 years!)
• renamed "AlphaDev Menu > List Functions" to "AlphaDev Menu > List Procedures",
  which now allows the user to select a specific namespace.
• new "AlphaDev Menu > List Variables" menu item for any defined namespace.
• [procs::pick] allows the user to move up one level in list-pick recursion.
• got rid of the old dialogs code.  Hooray!
• fixed Tcl mode's control of Wish on MacOS X.
• provided slightly better theme metric support to dialogsNew.tcl
• revamped 'wordWrap' and popup handling in AlphaTcl.
• fix to [global::listPackages].
• new [dialog::buttonAlert] which makes use of new dialog code.  (The core
  version doesn't handle multiple long button names very well.)
• new AlphaTcl version of the previous core command [wrapText], based on
  the one previously implemented by Alphatk.  [wrapParagraph] now informs 
  the user of the results in the status bar.
• another "tetexComm.tcl" update from Joachim. (thanks!)
• if "autoContinueComment" is turned on [characterInsertedHook] automatically
  wraps text in comments even when "wordWrap" is set to "None".  (This has 
  actually been true for quite a while, but users of the latest Alpha8/X 
  binaries will soon be noticing this for the first time.)
• removed the hook 'fileMovedHook' (not the proc), replacing it with
  calls to winChangeNameHook in all cases.  This only affects the core
  package openWindowsMenu which is now simpler than before.
• documented '-tag' and '-action' in "Dialogs Help.pdf"
• removed some of the more longstanding BackCompatibility obsolete procs
• further use of window attributes, removing the win::Modes array
  entirely (it was already private to AlphaTclCore; now it's gone).
• fix to gap at top of dialog when dialog::handle converts a single 
  page dialog to a multipage one.
• fix to minor-mode code and handling of colortags
• a fix to tetexComm.tcl from Joachim, for better log parsing.
• added documentation for displayWrap, displayPlatform, displayEncoding,
  and corrected case of items shown in status bar.
• removed filesetTabPreference.tcl (the filesetIndentation package does
  everything it does and more).
• fix to popup menu sizes (from dialog::menu) esp. on OS X.
• allow editDocument to handle ~user/paths (bug 1229)
• added '-pager listbox' and '-pager tabs' support to new dialogs code, and 
  made use of this in the new preferences (for Alphatk only).
• fix to Tcl indentation with odd indentation amounts
• small fixes to Diff mode
• update to "Dialogs Help"
• improved TeX completions (thanks Gianguido)
• fix to TeX mode marking (with unbalanced parentheses, say)
• the new dialogs code now explicitly disallows items with the same
  $page,$name, unless they are of the same type.  It also has better
  handling of empty page names in the single->multipage transition.
  Also fixed a bug with the handling of {thepage} with pages split
  through discretionary items.
• added 'User Menu' package from Bernard.
• exposed 'indent using spaces only' and 'indentation amount' as
  window-specific items in the status-bar popup menu.
• added menu to 'Bat' mode.
• enhanced [file::openViaListpicks], with handy status bar messages.
• minor adjustments for some [alpha::listAlphaTclPackages] list creations.
• fix to wrapping in characterInsertedHook (bug 1384)
• fix to 'insert path name' (bug 1387)
• new 'suffix mappings' dialog from Craig.
• fix to menu::removeFrom (bug 1382)
• added 'Favourites' package and removed 'Switch To', as per discussion
  on alphatcl-users.
• [comment::undoBox/Paragraph] now use [comment::GetRegion] "uncomment" arg
  (This uncovered a position bug in the previously unused script.)
• renamed zapInvisibles to zapNonPrintables
• improved 'lth' in Shel mode.
• some minor rearrangement of main menus, following (RFE 1390).
• corrected $userMenu for userMenu as appropriate in the new User Menu
  package.
• resolved some issues with setting sig/appspec items in new prefs dialogs
• fix to auto-wrapping bug when space was pressed
• moved 'Choose A Window...' down in the Open Windows Menu (RFE 1390)
• refactoring of AlphaTcl startup code and AlphaTclCore to make very
  clear which code is required in the early startup phases.  In
  particular various files and/or code have been moved to 'Init', as
  follows:
    Startup: PreGui stage (can't even using status::msg)
	* initAlphaTcl.tcl - controller for this stage
	* tclAutoload.tcl - set up over-rides of some of Tcl's auto_load 
          mechanism and provide routines for setting auto_path appropriately 
          for AlphaTcl
	* alphaVersionInfo.tcl - declare current version
	* pathManagement.tcl - handling paths, encodings, checks for paths 
          inside AlphaTcl or not, etc.
	* coreImplementations.tcl - define new, edit and over-ride bgerror 
          from Tcl.
	* cache.tcl - cache handling library
	* prefsHandling.tcl - routines to load/save and declare preferences.
    Startup: Beginning of main Startup: Package Rebuild stage 
    (now status bar exists)
	* rebuildAlphaTcl.tcl - controller for this stage
	* rebuild.tcl - routines to build new indices
	* pkgsDeclare.tcl - alpha::package/mode/menu/feature/library etc routines.
  This is followed by the rest of the alpha::Startup sequence
  (package loading etc).
• redid cache handling to resolve problems reported at startup.  Not
  sure why these problems arose (since I didn't see them).  New cache::*
  procedures are more helpful when dealing with namespaces.
• menubar menu dividers are now unique to help with AlphaTcl menu insertions.
• "newDocument" package update (v 1.0.1), creating "File > New" submenu.
• [bind::CarriageReturn] better surrounding whitespace handling. (bug 974)
• added statusPopupMenus.tcl to CorePackages.
• undid premature AlphaTcl version increase to 8.0b8
• fixed window-specific wrapping code
• added support for setting window-visibility on opening.  This works
  with the '-visibility (hidden|normal|minimized)' option to 'new', 
  and requires a new Alphatk command 'windowVisibility ?-w win? state'.
• added 'description' to most packages
• moved addition of search menu items to the superSearch package,
  including handling of dimming when appropriate (bug 1405)
• improved menu building at startup for more robustness and less
  redundant rebuilding.

• fix to 'lth' in Shell mode.
• updated Terminal package from Lars
• [prompt] -> [::prompt] (namespace issue) in "statusPopupMenus.tcl"
• status bar menus are rebuilt after item is executed, to make sure that
  they are updated if they were previousy torn off.
• tweaked TeX mode funcExpr for better {} menu matching of multi-line
  section names
• added 'Dot' mode -- thanks Joachim.
• added hook::callAll characterInsertedHook as per alphatcl-developers 
  discussion.
• added 'align*' environment to TeX mode (thanks to Jean-Eric for the report)
• new "teTeX Help" file from Joachim.  This is hyperlinked in the "Release Notes"
  file and in the "LaTeX Help", and in the "TeX Menu > LaTeX Help" menu.
• The VC menu will automatically use the "CVS" tool when appropriate.
• released with Alpha8 8.0b16 and AlphaX 8.0b16
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following were made after the "release" of AlphaTcl 8.0b7, but before
the actual version number was changed in "alphaVersionInfo.tcl".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• cleaned up [requireOpenWindowsHook] and its callers, plus made changes
  to TIP mode's use of the hook to allow TIP mode dimming/enabling to
  work correctly again (package index rebuild will be needed).
• fixed 3 bugs in supersearch (thanks).
• new "AlphaDev Distribution > Generate Pre-Built Cache" menu item.
• updated M2 mode (v. 4.0.3) from Andreas
• Fix for [winfo] call in "Tcl > Run..." which failed in Alpha8/X.

  error when no tclIndex files are present.
• fix for [file writable] failure on remote volumes (bug 405)
• put "numLock" [prefs::modified] fix back in place (bug 1236)
• AlphaTcl workaround for supersearch use of Tcl [scancontext] which caused
  a crash with multi-file regexp searches using "\r" (bug 1264)
• various Setup Assistant improvements (RFE 1379)
• "TeX::smartEscape" regexp fix for \label 'prefix' (bug 1505)
• Alpha8 VC [vcs::ckid::readResource] package requirement fixed (bug 1520)

• "Search > Replace In Fileset" now has ellipses. (bug 1535)
• [prompt::simple] error if [entry::validate] fails (bug 1546)
• [Tcl::getVarFromList] error if the selection contains several words (bug 1547)
• fix for creation of new ftp filesets, password handling failure (bug 1550)
• moved "Help > Changes" files into "AlphaDev Help" (RFE 1534)
• "indentOnReturn" prefs added to Mf and Mp modes (RFE 1544)
• [savePostHook] now checks dimming of "File > Rename To" (in bug 1494)
• the package: versionControl is now defined as "always-on" (RFE 1511)
  This helps simplify some of the documentation, still needs more work.
• Better "ReplOpts" dialog in "Search > Find" (in bug 1551)
• [hiliteWord] now calls [requireOpenWindow] (bug 1555)
• changed some bindings, as per alphadev discussions:
  - command-M is now minimize (the new name for 'iconify')
  - control-I is now indent (which will select between indent line and
  indent selection as appropriate)
  - control-command-F is now find in next file (bugs 1022, 1516)
• [chooseAWindow] uses most recently active window as default (bug 1576)
• better [file::openViaListpicks] defaults, saved between sessions.
• moved upcaseRegion, downcaseRegion to AlphaTcl (RFE 1568)
• made 'Indent Selection' reselect once complete (RFE 1567)

================================================================================
• Alpha8/X don't take over the numeric keypad by default. (bugs 1181, 1236)

================================================================================
• rearrangement of startup cache checking to ensure even if PREFS is
  over-ridden it is assigned the correct encoding and the built-in cache
  can be used.
• fixes to Tcl mode communication with external interpreters.
• new [help::prefString] procedure, to avoid calling [cache::readContents]
  throughout AlphaTcl.  "index::prefshelp" is a global variable that is 
  defined during init of AlphaTcl, and it should always be available.
• some minor menu adjustments (e.g. removed 'gotoMatch')
• allowed pos::diff to return positive or negative values.
• copied over regexp info into "Regular Expressions" and put it back in the
  help menu -- needs rework to direct its contents more towards the use of
  regexps in the search dialog.
• fix to 'source' redefinition when using Tcl 8.4 ('info script') -- thanks Lars.
• provide bindings for Enter and ',' (= '.') in Calc mode -- thanks Frédéric.
• rename 'tclExtensionsFolder' to 'smarterSourceFolder' (thanks Joachim).
• getAscii improved
• added basic validation to dialog::getUrl
• fix to 'edit -mode' arguments, where the window name must come last.
• fileset ftp mirror fix
• S+/R interactions are only available in MacClassic, probably need to make
  use of the "xserv" package here (in "sMode.tcl")
• updated "Extending Alpha" with the new 'TM' menu form modifier.
• updated alphaServer and alphac script (thanks Frédéric).
• added 'windowZoom' package and Batch, Verilog, VB modes (thanks!)
• fix to help in overall package preferences dialog (it's still not correct 
  in the Miscellaneous page, but that must wait until we use the new dialogs 
  code)
• S+/R interactions re-enabled in OSX, per suggestions from Andreas.  The 
  mechanism for setting the S+/R sigs should be revisited further.
• fix to handling of 'recurseIn' filesets with 'update/create'
• changed 'Replace & Find Again' binding to shift-cmd-G after discussion in
  Bug 978.
• fix bug in Windows menu for windows whose names match the pre-existing
  menu items (zoom, default size, etc), and for windows whose name contains 
  a trailing ellipsis (...)
• changed' Replace & Find Again' binding to Command-J after a re-count of
  the votes in bug 978.
• documented new core proc [saveResources] and new option [getGeometry -s], 
  added in Alpha8/X 8.0b12.

  $menubarHeight works with Alpha8/X 8.0b12, where that global is available.
• alphaServer makes 'alphac' script executable automatically.
• Removed workaround bug 933 in filePreOpeningHook. Alpha8/X core now fixed.
• fix to infinite loop in WWW menu for some html pages

================================================================================
• electrics fixes
• fixed paragraph procs -- thanks Joachim.
• added "AlphaCvs" submenu in AlphaDeveloperMenu (RFE 969 in Bugzilla)

  fixed in a Tcl source code now).
• added use of a new 'highlight' command to interactiveSearch.tcl, only
  currently implemented in Alphatk.
• upgraded smarterSource and some bits of AlphaTcl to allow better over-riding
  of core code.
• added Xserv and InSh mode.  Some more work needs to happen to transfer
  control of various helpers to xserv, and to integrate xserv better with
  the rest of AlphaTcl but the framework is now in place.
• added supersearch documentation
• minor fixes to cleanup processes in recent files multi
• updated version control code to remove some dialog clutter (thanks Craig)

• revamp of AlphaDev menu.  Needs testing thoroughly.
• Wiki menu appears in Global section of Menus dialog, now has its own
  separate [alpha::mode] and [alpha::menu] declarations.
• use of 'eq' and 'ne' in AlphaTcl.  Some of these fix problems when using
  windows with names like '1', '1.0', '1.000' which would otherwise compare
  as equal using '=='.
• more cleanup of "electricTab" references, in both packages and help files.
• improved 'New Document' dialog.
• 'From Directory' and 'From Hierarchy' filesets automatically convert
  an empty pattern into "*", avoiding possible infinite loops.
• minor Tcl mode completions fix.
• removed "httpHandler" and "versionControlMenu" packages.
• removed "elecBindings" package and all package/help references to it.

• Added XHTML support to HTML mode.
• Updated "Readme" -- thanks Joachim!

  (at least one of these two is needed by the new dialog).
• moved 'Set Fonts Tabs' to Open Windows menu.
• made Elec Completions/Expansions always on, as per alphatcl-developers
  discussion.
• added 'file::hasOpenWindows' and used it to make various filesetUtils

  which has been fixed in Tcl 8.4.4.
• updated "Alpha Commands" to show proper arguments to various commands.
• wider use of optional right/left column arguments to 'breakIntoLines'
• moved 'softProc' to alphaHooks.tcl where all other procedures called by 
  Alpha's core are found.
• prefs saving deals better with prefs containing newline characters.
• added "Forget Pattern" button to search dialog.
• rename text::halfTab and text::Tab to text::halfIndent and text::standardIndent
  to be clearer on what they do (*not* anything to do with tab size!)
• couple of small fixes to new dialogs code regarding 'hidden' dialog items.
• 'Edit A Fileset...' dialog now allows attaching/detaching information in
  place.  (New file "filesetsAttachments.tcl" added to AlphaTclCore)

• cleaned up and fixed uses of '-l' and help in the dialogs code
• fix to reporting of errors in your prefs.tcl file.
• fixed problems with specialSet/specialView due to foolish conflict between
  'file' and 'dialog::specialSet::file'.
• added some support to LaTeX mode for 'Sychronize Doc' with 'yap' and 'xdvi'
  where these are available (various Windows, Unix machines, including OS X,
  potentially).  This is bound to 'Control-`' as is used for TeXtures.
• fix to file::getSig, file::getType on Alphatk, MacOS X, when operating
  on filesystems for which type/creator are not supported.
• added 'unset' in various places to ensure temporary global variables created
  by various packages are cleaned up (and removed from the global namespace).
• some additions to LaTeX mode's user guide.  *Lots* of work still needed.
• fixes to metafont and metapost modes for Alphatk where positions can 
  contain spaces (caused infinite loop in metafont file marking). (There 
  are also 3 suspicious 'eval [concat search' lines in manipCols.tcl which 
  may need fixing).
• implemented minimal support for command-line 'mf' in metafont mode.
• Macros package v 1.4.x -- changes in internal storage of lists and arrays.
• added 'Testing' submenu to Alpha Developer menu.
• cleaned up a few modes to remove problems revealed by testing them all.
• Macros package v 1.5 -- new Edit Saved Macro routines.
• made TeX mode manual available in PDF format.
• added experimental interactive code to TeX mode.  Use Shift-Command-R to
  launch an interactive session, on MacOS X or Windows.  (This code will
  later be integrated into the standard TeX Process menu).
• couple of small fixes/workarounds to Diff and Browser modes (thanks Craig)

• fix to '-w' parsing when there are very few arguments.
• removed a couple of minor instances of global variable pollution

  only applies to single file searches at present.
• added 'edit -mode' support for Alpha 8/X
• added 'alphaServer.tcl' package, and updated xserv, InSh mode 
  (many thanks to Frédéric)
• resolve a subtle bug in 'saveAs' wrt mode-changing, particularly for
  files with no extension.
• added 'alphac' and 'alphae' to Tools
• removed references to "wordBreakPreface" variable.
• added "indentOnReturn" variable to most text-editing modes with a default
  value of "0" so that users can turn it on if desired.  ("electricReturn"
  can no longer turned on globally.)
• various Help file updates.
• added Joachim's scripts to find your environment's 'path' (and other 
  variables)

• added to the manual a preliminary discussion of Alpha X/tk's interaction 
  with the command-line 
• fixes to the vfs fileset.
• fixes to M2 mode uninstallation

  could match the given file, rather than the first.
• added proc: quote::AllNonAscii
• small fix to dictionary package for fontSize other than 9.
• updated the whole 'set...' and drag-n-drop dialog functionality to
  avoid the peculiar use of 'hook::' which was fragile and confusing, plus
  it contained some bugs which are now fixed.
• added 'bgerror' implementation to coreImplementations.tcl
• fix to TeX mode obsolete proc handling
• added further Alphatk support to installer, and made existing support

================================================================================
• dictionary package font size fixes, documented key bindings.
• encoding of www parsing corrected, fixed redef of status::msg (bug 865).
• setext Mode regexp fixes.
• added projectBuilderMenu.
• fix to TclAE initialization after index rebuild (bug 846).
• Fileset Utilities menu calls proper 'tag::' procs. (bug 854)
• 'Tcl-tk Help' no longer included in list of menu bindings to change.
• New [Tcl::listArray|showVarValue] procs, which use current interpreter,
  while [::listArray|showVarValue] are only for values known to AlphaTcl.
  (These last two could be moved out of the "tclMode.tcl" file and into
  some AlphaTcl core file so that they're always available.) (bug 855)
• [Tcl::defaultColors] now refreshes window (as it used to).
• "Tcl::interpCmd" is initially set to [tcltk::internalEvaluate], not
  an empty string, to ensure Tcl mode procs called with no Tcl window
  will never throw an error.
• New "AlphaDev --> Alpha Bugzilla" submenu.
• New "AlphaDev --> Distribution --> Update Bugzilla Product Version"
  menu item, could be expanded to use the 'http' package to automatically
  send updated info.
• Bindings pref for AlphaDev menu used properly (was reversed).
• Better exit message with [function::select] to avoid error window.
• New global var $alpha::application containing the app name.
• Packages window uses correct app name.
• New appearance pref flag "Dont Use Command H", enabled by default
  on AlphaX. If set, use Command-Shift-H for Replace&FindAgain.
• On AlphaX, don't add a quit item to the File menu as the standard
  application menu has a quit item already.

= 8.0d2 released   			   	               last update: 24/3/03 10:00:48
================================================================================
• replacement of 'lsort -ignore' by 'lsort -dictionary' (the former will
  now throw an error).
• replacement of namespace_exists by 'namespace exists'
• removal of many [info tclversion] checks (*all* will be removed in the end)
• replaced all 'file::separator' accesses by '[file separator]' (note: on
  Windows this value has therefore changed from '/' to '\' which may break
  some code).
• added 'tkcon' package
• added 'fileset indentation preference' package
• Added a changeModeFrom hook to inform code of what mode
  we're just leaving.  This takes as an argument the mode
  we're leaving. The code can examine $mode to determine
  the new mode.
• add framework for xml mode.
• deleted all procs except a handful from BackCompatibility.tcl
• small improvement to Tcl mode's 'Add Remove Dollars'
• added 'tdom' based parsing to xml mode, if it is available (this requires
  a binary extension called 'tdom').
• added 'C#' mode.
• added 'typewriter tab' functionality (from alphatcl-users).
• added "User Packages" directory to $PREFS, together with a new menu item.
  We need installer enhancements to go with this -- feedback needed!
• added Joachim Kock's dictionary package
• improvement to quote::Prettify to cope with '::' better.
• added Windown's .cmd suffix to sh mode.
• added support for DiffBOA to Diff mode.
• updated 'comments' package from Craig.
• much improved TeX reference completion (and simplification of core 
  completion routines) from Joachim -- thanks!
• added xml completion routine (needs 'tdom').
• Added 'package::makeOnOrOff' for M2 mode.  Allows code to programmatically
  do the same things that the user does from the menus/features dialogs.
• added 'leadingTabsToSpaces' 'leadingSpacesToTabs'
• added "tcltkExtendedC.tcl" package from Craig.
• added newer betterTemplates implementation from Craig.
• various aeom/tcl related fixes, specifically for Alphatk.
• removed 'newforeach' since we're using Tcl 8 now.
• added ability to distribute a pre-built package Cache with AlphaTcl
  to avoid first-time users having a very long startup process.
• added '-w win' optional argument to various procs in AlphaTcl.  Modified
  tmark::getPos, tmark::getRange, mark::getRange to adhere to the '-w win'
  approach rather than an ad hoc way of specifying a window.
  (Required minor change to Diff mode which was the only user of those procs).
• added Joachim's newer, simpler 'completion::Find' and removed the 
  'listpick if non-unique stuck completion' preference flag.
• moved 'posX' and 'lineEnd' procs into obsolete set.  The 'pos::' procedures
  should be used.
• added Craig's 'tabsToSpaces' etc.
• better position remembering in paragraph fill routines.
• updated Tcl mode to version 3.0 (thanks Craig)
• fixes and improvements to BibTeX mode completions.
• removed entire 'quote tabs and newlines' stuff from supersearch -- it
  was confusing, got in the way of certain searches (e.g. TeX) and, in 
  particular with the 'AutoGrep' button, the same effect can be achieved 
  much more cleanly.
• replaced all AEBuild with tclAE::send -p
• added 'hook::procRename', and related helpers which can be used to
  make smartPaste and copyRing much more robust in the way they take
  over 'paste'
• hooks updates for Alpha8 8.0b7 & AlphaX 8.0a8: no longer call 
  filePreOpeningHook from activateHook since the core now calls it directly.
• conditionalized core fixes that are no longer needed with 8.0b7/X 8.0a8.
• use 8.0b7/X 8.0a8 core [new] that takes same extra args as Alphatk [new].

  'Global M2 Bindings' package if you want them.
• newer version of tkdiff distributed in Tools
• removed yet more uncaught errors ('bind::RightBrace' for example)
• supersearch fix for Alpha 7
• fix to usage of Tcl's ftp package.
• prefs::modified now uses namespace-relative variable names.  A
  side-effect of this change is that variable names sent to prefs::modified 
  must already exist.  Otherwise an error is thrown.
• fix unix-man page url in 'sh' mode.
• cosmetic fix to menus/features dialogs, and an increase in their
  height if the screen size allows.  Also added support for '-labelframe',
  but only for Alphatk, Tk >= 8.4.
• error-throwing fix to the bug reporter.
• fixes to HTML mode, prefs renaming, dialogs, bindings list.
• Tcl 8 fix to supersearch prefs saving.
• filesets and filesetsMenu fixes, particularly when deleting temporary
  filesets.
• report errors in saving preferences to the user when quitting, and give 
  them the option of cancelling the 'quit'
• large number of fixes from alphatcl developers mailing list and the 
  alpha-bugzilla bug tracking system
• reorganization of Tcl Menu
• WWW menu now at 2.4.1; fixes a number of bugs

• more small fixes from alphatcl-developers mailing list.
• fixes to WWW menu and latex-filesets.
• new embrace.tcl package (thanks Joachim)

================================================================================
• Config menu overhauled for greater consistency (thanks Bernard).
• small supersearch changes for greater usability and consistency with 
  old Alpha behaviours
• file::getSig and file::getType now work in Alpha X. Replaced some
  occurences of getFileSig and getFileType by file::getSig and file::getType
• 'Beep on error' is now off by default.
• added better 'shiftBy' implementation for block left/right
  indentation of text (thanks to Joachim Kock)
• 'Browse in fileset' works again.
• more supersearch fixes for ^...$ matching with replaceAll
• fix to 'viewValue' (actually to tclLog)
• better implementation of 'quote tabs and newlines' in the search
  dialog.
• removed use of 'keys::international' in Alphatk.  It may be good to
  do the same in the future for Alpha 8/X (assuming handling of bindings 
  can be appropriately fixed)
• fix to electric wrapping for TeX mode.
• added 'cut and copy using pin' preference, which will allow the
  behaviour using the pin to be removed from Alpha's core cut/copy
  implementations.
• removed some 'dialog::errorAlert' from supersearch, and other code.
• Fixed a problem with Home page settings and dropped character in links in 
  HTML mode.
• added 'closeAll' to coreImplementations for when Alpha 8/X drop it.
• number of small fixes to avoid throwing errors
• add support to mail mode for Alphatk's ability to color '>' only at 
  the beginning of the line.
• HTML and CSS menus now properly disable/enable menu items when the menus
  are used globally.
• don't flash up the "Packages" window at startup.
• removed use of 'configuration' file in cache, so AlphaTcl is now
  robust to having the cache deleted.  The global::features and
  alpha::home preferences are now stored in your early preferences, as 
  they should be.  This also allows the cache to be moved (e.g. to
  [file join $HOME Cache]), which means it can be placed inside a
  distribution and avoid having a first time user wait a few minutes
  for the package indices to rebuild.  Alphatk/8/X can do this by 
  setting the 'alpha::cache' variable.
• some windows-specific Alphatk changes for better bindings.
• small simplification to large number of 'if {[expr {...}]}' statements (the
  'expr' is unnecessary).
• some cleanup of "Alpha Commands" and alpha developer menu.
• better error handling in supersearch.
• file::searchFor returns a pair of file offsets which must be
  converted into valid positions.  Changed it and the code which
  uses it.
• added some '--' arguments in various calls to completion::general, to
  avoid problems when trying to complete words which start with '-'.
• file::readAll and file::writeAll now take an optional encoding argument
• file::convertLineEndings no longer mangles files which aren't utf-8 
  encoded 
• changed a number of commands to silently do nothing when there's no 
  window
• changed a number of editing commands to display the message "Read-only!" when the 
  window is read-only
• small fix to filesets menu with 'recurse in' filesets creation.
• added proper help-prefs dialog to the setup assistant.
• various fixes from alphatcl-developers
• removed some catches which tended to clobber $errorInfo (not vital,
  but somewhat cleaner - AlphaTcl's error logging/reporting code
  should really be used in preference to 'display errorInfo' now).

• new hook::callAll implementation which avoids recursive calling in
  favour of a queue (need to check for unintended consequences).
• added more info on hooks to "Extending Alpha"
• General overhaul of 'saveasHook' and things which use it, to simplify
  what is going on and ensure hooks are called at proper times and in a 
  well-defined, consistent way.  Replaced 'saveasHook' with 
  'winChangeNameHook', since that is more appropriate.
• fix to 'linkToFile' problem in colorsMenu
• fixes to Textures interface in TeX mode.
• moved 'display errorInfo' to Tcl menu.
• new develoments in AppleScript mode (support for contexts, compiling and 
execution flags, scrpting terminology faster)
• added !!includefilter syntax to FiltersMenu to include a filter from 
another filter. FiltersMenu split into 5 files.
• use [regexp] instead of [string trimleft] to extract alpha::version
from [version[, allows for clearer AlphaX version string.
• improved WWW menu
• fixes to Tab bindings in a number of modes.
• supersearch fixes for Alpha8/X with core find removed.
• added preference to control AlphaX Quickdraw Text antialiasing.
• various small fixes, including to convertEols and 'glob' in Tcl 8.3.x

  Alphattk/8/X (dialogsUtils.tcl)
• renamed 'electricColon' to 'specialIndentForCaseLabel'
• Alpha8/X using Tcl8.4 no longer display startup error when TclX unavailable.

  when doing 'next match' (Control-M)
• fix to message from completions mechanism when just changing search
  direction. (thanks Holger) (still need to fix bug that completions
  can't be restarted after they come to an end).

  Alphatk, at last.

• cleanup of "alphaDefinitions.tcl", and fix to some preferences which 
  were active on the wrong platform.
• added support for 'aspell' (and probably ispell) spell-checking
  through command-line pipes on MacOS X/Unix/Win.  New file
  "spellcheck.tcl".  This all occurs inside Alpha windows.  Supports
  text and TeX files.  Could add spell-checking of text inside comments
  to a future release, in any mode.
• add Craig's bibConvert 2.0

• let HTML mode determine the charset/encoding for files automatically,
  if 'charset=....' is in the first two lines of the file (Bug#600).

• couple of small fixes to TeX mode dimming/marking.
• bulk replacement of 'message' with 'status::msg' in AlphaTcl core.

  encodings first in the popup menu.
• fix to supersearch multi-line problem with '\n' line-ending.
• moved a scanmatch script in supersearch into a procedure which will

• better file::decompress for AlphaX/tk
• let read-only files be auto-marked.
• better Tcl example, and better handling of 'execute in remote' shell

  examples-opening.
• fix some small issues with Alphatk in some modes.
• newer 'Alpha Developer Menu'
• various fixes to installer and related open/close-hook and open
  windows menu bugs, all associated with closing a window inside an

• renamed 'alpha::defaultEncoding' to 'alpha::internalEncoding' since
  that is more accurate.
• added 'defaultEncoding' preference for Alphatk only which can be used
  to specify the preferred overall encoding.  Modified alphaOpen
  appropriately.

================================================================================
• internationalMenus package is now integrated with 'remove meta keys
  from menus' so they are now mutually compatible and Alphatk can now
  make use of international keyboards.  "windowsMenuFixes.tcl" is now
  obsolete.  The internationalMenus package is now always on, as well.
  Updated AlphaTcl version to force package rebuild which this change
  needs.
• updated 'new dialogs' code -- thanks Lars.
• in Tcl 8 or newer check that encoding of files seems to be ok, and
  warn if not (and offer to quit) -- initAlphaTcl.tcl
• ensure 'tcl_platform(windowingsystem)' is set.

• fix to TeX::optionTitlebar
• added a variety of help files and mpwMode from Bernard - thanks.

  anyway.
• put in proper paragraph wrapping in Wiki mode.

• removed duplicate redefinitions of 'source'
• various small fixes/improvements from Craig.

================================================================================
• moved the core 'tags' support to a new package in "tags.tcl". 
  Needs more work, but cleans up another piece of the core.  We will
  probably remove all hard-coded tags functionality from Alpha soon. 
  Upped the version number, since we're adding a new core package.
• added some validation to the mode creation assistant (more needed!).
• TIP mode allows editing of remote TIPs.
• A '(' couldn't be typed after 'if' in Perl mode. Fixed.
• Compiling was broken in Perl mode. Fixed.
• fix to www menu bookmarks for items ending in ellipsis.
• renamed 'the mark' to 'the pin'.  Once we've fixed on names for the
  new functions (markHilite, exchangePointAndMark) we can obsolete the 
  old.
• allow '-mode' as well as '-m' to 'new'.  Also added '-mode' to
  'edit', but it isn't yet implemented fully on all platforms, also
  edit handles '--' option-terminator better.
• fix to paragraphs::next (thanks Craig).
• added support for new core [refresh] command in Alpha8/X.
• fix to filesetsMenu reloading filesets.tcl every time the menu was
  used when running Tcl 8 or newer (note of caution wrt use of 'info commands'
  from inside a namespace).
• "Fill Paragraph" fix to multiple paragraphs (broken in 7.5,
  unfortunately).
• added '-w win' to text::minSpaceForm, text::maxSpaceForm,
  spacesEqualTab
• renamed posToRowCol pos::toRowCol, rowColToPos pos::fromRowCol, and
  added new pos::toRowChar, pos::fromRowChar.  These should all take
  optional '-w win' arguments.
• added to sourceforge menu so we can 'view cvs changes to file'. Need 
  to investigate whether it is a good idea to have some
  sfMenu<->filesets interaction.
• added 'wiki.tcl.tk' to sites recognised by Wiki mode.
• fix to www parsing for wiki pages which don't have a proper body.
• WWW menu handles <isindex> tags.
• fix to httpCopy for absolute redirect urls.
• www, Wiki, updated.
• positions.tcl significant update, to handle '-w <pos>' (thanks Craig).
• international menus fix for 'hilite to pin'.
• Fixed superSearch bug in Alpha 7.
• installer doesn't mess up the 'alpha::encodingFor' information on a 
  cancelled installation.
• 'alpha::encodingFor' deals with nested encoding settings -- it now
  uses the most specific rather than the first encoding it finds.
• 'alphaOpen' (the override of 'open' for use by code which wants to be
  encodings aware now takes an optional '-encoding $env' argument,
  and uses a different mechanism to preset encodings for given
  files (the old 'alpha::encoding' variable approach caused serious 
  problems if opening one window caused other files (e.g. elecMenu cache) 
  to be read).
• fixes to www menu (thanks Craig).
• fix to menu::buildHierarchy from 7.6d1.
• fix to infinite loop in paragraph::fillOne under rare
  circumstances.
• lots of fixes from Craig, plus improved examples, help, Wiki mode.
• added helpers for folding of code for Tcl, C++, Java modes.  Only Alphatk 
  supports this at present.
• fix to positions.tcl, splitting of changeMode.
• better procs::findEnclosing
• added folding support (TeX::foldableRegion) to TeX mode.
• fixed building tclIndices from scratch
• reorganized/consolidated AlphaTcl startup sequence for Alpha8/X/Tk.

================================================================================
• is::List fix (which results in better Tcl::parseFuncs)
• fix to 'evaluate' in Tcl mode (was broken for AlphaX and Alphatk on
  MacOS).
• fix to java mode for empty interface defn with mark/funcs.
• moved loading of prefs.tcl to slightly later in startup, so 'edit' 
  works properly at startup.
• small fix to bibtex mode.
• early preferences are now stored and handled in the same way as other
  preferences.  This means they are only saved if 'prefs::modified' has
  been called, and they are now stored in their own file, rather than in
  the 'configuration' file.  This fixes some Alphatk problems.
• menu::buildHierarchy now compresses folder hierarchies which contain
  only single folders, also simplified parts of the code.  Needs testing
  on MacOS.
• replaced a bunch of alpha.olm.net by http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/
  probably more needed.  Removed all remaining references.
• remove possibly problematic high bit chars like '$foo…'
• added Craig's "addressBook.tcl" package.
• replaced the contextual package with Craig's new contextualMenu package. 
  Also modified contextualMenuHook.
• Added some contextual menu support to HTML mode.
• added support for contextual menus to Alphatk
• fixed some line-ending problems with files committed under 'high bits'
• revamped how filesets menu is rebuilt, and made a clear distinction
  between 'rebuild all filesets' and 'rebuild filesetmenu'.
• small fix to HTML contextual menus, and addition of simple
  contextual menu to Tcl mode.
• fixed supersearch batch replace all problem for Alphatk
  (line-ending corruption) -- we need to test whether the same issue
  is a problem for Alpha 8 and Alpha X (see "superSearch.tcl").
• contextualMenu package enhanced, and works with Alphatk.
• Alphatk fix to C_isLineMulti
• C++ completions work again.
• added ability to unlock files before batch replace all in
  supersearch.  Added 'file::setLockState' which needs testing.
• added 'autoSaveOnSwitch' package from Craig.
• improved 'file::renameTo'
• addition of 'Wiki' mode, with first attempt at editing Wiki pages
  from within Alpha.  Need to add code to perform http 'post' action.
• better default button widths on AlphaX and Alphatk.
• openWindows menu starts goes from 1-9 then 0, [Bug 482]
• fix to package::uninstall, removed '--text' as default diff flags
  on Alphatk.
• added 'auto grep' to supersearch, using a first cut at a plug-in
  implementation for the search dialog -- may still need some work.
• AppleScript mode added by Bernard.
• simplified smartPaste on/off code.
• fix to install.tcl (thanks Lars)
• add 'viewCvsChangesToFile' to Alpha Developer Menu (connects to cvs-web)
• added Craig's "positions.tcl" --- some changes to this may still be
  required, and documentation should be written for Alpha Commands.
• added '\t\r\n' to TeX mode wordBreak definition.  Will see if there
  are any unwanted side-effects.  This is required for correct
  operation of the smartCutPaste behaviour.
• fixed startup bug caused by an error in the handling of the 
  locationOfStatusBar flag.
• added Java::quotedstringChar etc to Java mode.
• Diff mode more sensible when trying to Patch into a locked window.
• added 'mode' to savePostHook, and made Wiki menu/mode capable of
  posting an edited page back onto a web-based Wiki. WWW menu now
  also has 'reload' and 'refresh' which should work.
• further improvements to Wiki mode.
• menu::buildHierarchy is more robust, deals with directories
  containing single elements better, and is less entangled with the
  filesets code.  It also avoids leaving elements in the
  fsSubMenuInfo array unnecessarily (note: users may well have stray
  elements of that array saved in their prefs).

  fix is only there for Alpha 7.  We'll fix the problem properly in
  Alpha 8.
• undid bad change of, e.g. Tclstringcmds to TclstringOptions in Tcl
  Completions at some point.  This breaks the central completions
  code.
• fix to some minor 'completions' bugs, and some typos which were
  introduced at some point.
• updated dialogsNew and related code.
• revamped some of the completions code.  This fixes some of the
  recently reported bugs (and some other bugs I found lurking), but
  has probably introduced some new problems.  The new code is rather
  more understandable, however, so I hope any new problems are easy to
  fix.  If not, we'll back these changes out.

• increased docProjects search limit for 'last update' to 3000 chars
  so it handles this file!
• small completions fixes, and templates.tcl fix for Alphatk (and
  speed up in general for ring::clear).
• couple more fixes to completions, primarily for TeX completions.
• more small TeX completions fixes.
• added '::correctBracesIndentation' which is like the old version
  which handles braces and can be used by modes which want decent
  indentation for braces without the hassle of writing their own
  procedure (e.g. proc Caml::correctIndentation {args} {
  uplevel 1 ::correctBracesIndentation $args } ).
• added various 'bind' procs to handle Enter issues with different
  keycodes on different keyboards (thanks Johan).

• moved url::makeAbsolute to the core.
• added '-s' to search in Setx mode.
• updated the dialogs part of AlphaTcl responsible for in-place
  changes according to the discussion on alphatcl-developers.
  In particular, Alpha tk/X/8 have no knowledge of AlphaTcl's
  dialog types now.
  Thanks to Jon, Lars for helpful discussion.
• made AlphaTcl preferences saving and loading independent of $HOME,
  so the user can relocate all of Alpha(tk) and not have things like
  recent files, filesets etc fail.  Just internal changes to
  prefsHandling.tcl.  This applies to any prefereneces saved using
  the standard 'prefs::modified' mechanism.
• added wwwMenu to the standard menu set on Alphatk and Alpha 8 (but
  not on Alpha 7 becuase it isn't so useful there).
• small fix to auto-marking so "M2 Tutorial.M2" is correctly hyperised.
• update to isIn.tcl and tests (thanks Joachim)
• fix to latex parseFuncs defn to work for \section{foo}\label{blah}
• fix to 'smartDots' in latex and bibtex modes (thanks Joachim)
• some more fixes/improvements to www Menu (thanks Craig).
• when using http pacakge, identify ourselves as AlphaTcl.
• added quote::Unhtml which is needed by wwwMenu.  Probably needs
  improving with code from HTML mode.  This fixes a problem in wwwMenu
  for pages whose titles contain '&gt;' and things like that.
• fix to setext mode for Alphatk.
• sh mode added.
• added global proc 'urlView' which in Alpha 8/tk can choose between
  internal viewing and sending to a browser.  Used by Setx mode and
  Tcl mode.
• added 'win::MakeTitle' for shortening and otherwise manipulating
  strings which we want to use as window titles (fixes problem in
  wwwMenu).
• fix to text mode marking to avoid crash on ChangeLogs.
• uninstall fix.
• changed default general plug-in binding for HTML mode on Alphatk only
  so it doesn't conflict with 'enter replace string'.
• added '-ignore' to lsort of help menu.
• moved winNameToNum manipulation out of 'fileMovedHook' and into
  open-windows-menu where it belongs.
• made default fileset name 'AlphaTclCore', not 'System'
• added 'functions.tcl' from setext mode.  Fix to ISOtime.tcl.
• small changes to move some package menus to more convenient
  locations.
• added M2 tutorial and completions.
• made diff default flag '+text' in Alpha, and '--text' in Alphatk.
• small fix to fileUtils.tcl (file was ascii corrupted at some point).
• some improvements and fixes to alphaDeveloperMenu
• added 'file::coreCopy' to allow installers and other code to be
  encoding aware when dealing with AlphaTcl's core.
• small fix to vcsCore.tcl
• added some html stuff to htmlUtilities.tcl in the core, but
  'quote::unhtml' needs improving still.
• ignore CVS directories in configuration check.

================================================================================
= 7.5a2 released			   		   last update: 09/14/2001 {09:42:08 AM}
================================================================================
• improvements to filesetsMenu handling of filesets which throw errors.
• small Alphatk fix to dialogsNew.tcl.
• fix to url downloading from lists.
• added M2-mode from Andreas.  Significant modifications so it works 
  with AlphaTcl and so it doesn't load everything at startup.  Also
  bunch of changes so it has a chance of working with Alphatk and
  AlphaX.
• fixed problem with dialog::describe (thanks for err info report)
• updated bibToHtml
• fix to dialog storage issue introduced in 7.5a1; fixes setting of
  package preferences, amongst other problems.
• fix to odbEditor.tcl
• fix to temporary filters file name on non-MacOS platforms.
• Setx mode menu bindings are now mode-dependent.
• added proper support for encodings to AlphaTcl for use by Alpha 8 & Tk
• better installer building in alphaDeveloperMenu, installer now uses
  macRoman encoding properly (on all platforms).
• no need to call 'mode::updateSuffixes' after addMode, since addMode
  will now ensure the suffix list is correct (This should also speed
  up startup, since calling mode::updateSuffixes is not very fast).
• fixed some Alphatk and windows-specific issues with manipCols.
• converted some uses of 'insertColorEscape' to 'text::color' for
  better Alphatk compatibility.
• more fixes to M2 mode.  In the process of fixing M2 mode,
  encountered a variety of subtleties in AlphaTcl and Alphatk's
  approaches to initialising modes, changing modes, creating new
  windows which have been fixed.  This should mean AlphaTcl is now
  more robust to creatively written modes.  Part of this process was
  to add the 'loadAMode' proc to alphaHooks.tcl.
• changeMode now throws an error if an attempt is made to changeMode 
  while another changeMode is in progress.  Before no error was thrown
  but various global preferences could get unset.  Now at least the
  problem will not impact AlphaTcl's core, only the strangely written
  code which is attempting that.
• potentially fixed problem with 'rm' not removing '.' files.
• lots of fixes from Craig; also updated wwwMenu declaration,
  splitting it into a mode and menu, which is more robust.
• removed 'bind::continueComment' binding and replaced it with
  the opposite (as per Craig's email).
• added support to latex mode for additional flags in typeset
  (so you can add '--src' for MikTeX).
• improved electricSemi
• mentioned avoiding commands with '.' in "Extending Alpha"
• some macros fixes.

================================================================================
= 7.5a1 released			   		   last update: 09/10/2001 {13:20:29 PM}
================================================================================
• transition to first alpha release.  Bug fixes only will be applied
  to AlphaTcl until the final release of this development cycle.
  note: some old/obsolete packages or files may be removed from this
  distribution before 7.5 final.
• small fix to file::pathStartsWith (mostly relevant to Alpha 8)
• improved handling of 'pdflatex' with .dtx files.  Updated New
  Dialogs documentation.
• improved procs::debug and procedures to jump to correct errorInfo
  location.
• added explanation of -dnd to New Dialogs documentation.
• updated WWW menu from Craig (made it use the 'temp' package instead 
  of accessing PREFS directly), fixed various menu building issues and
  made sure bindings are mode-dependent.
• Moved comments and paragraphs code into the core.
• Lots of small fixes to filtersMenu for Alphatk -- most operations 
  should now work.
• bunch of fixes to supersearch's 'performSearch'.
• upgrade to metafont mode 2.0.2, replaced some 'goto 0' with 
  'goto [minPos]', esp in mf, filters, and
  some other obsolete procs (add/remove arrDef, etc).  Fixed lots of
  uses of 'search ... 0' and other pos abuses --- latex, elec menu,
  html mode, fortran, etc.
• couple of fixes to newDialog.tcl code due to the re-entrancy changes
  (thanks Dominique)
• moved some stuff to new 'Developer' folder.
• small fix to comment paragraph filling at beginning of file.
• fixed small problem in coreFixes.tcl

================================================================================
= 7.5d28 released			   		   last update: 09/07/2001 {17:43:51 PM}
================================================================================
• fix in copyRing.
• much improved file::tryToFindInFolder
• improved file::decompress and install::fromRemoteUrl to cope with
  .tgz, .tar (at least on Alphatk).
• added url::getAFile similar to url::download, but will look inside
  directories for a file, and used by the installer.  Also added some
  intelligence so if we download a directory listing that may get
  treated as a directory.
• fix to defaultSize procedure to do what its name says.
• improved and fixed getEnvironment in latex mode (thanks Chris)
• fixed small bug in Tcl::FindEntireFunctionDeclaration
• improved quote::Prettify
• added new dialog::make implementation from Lars Hellstrom -- a big
  improvement for anything which uses it (e.g. edit filesets).  Also
  modified the old and new code so everything is entirely re-entrant
  and all intermediate values are stored in a unique array for each
  dialog.  Removed obsolete code from filesets and made vcsCore use
  the new dialogs correctly.  The dialogsNew.dtx and documentation
  needs to be updated for these changes.  Note these changes mean
  the global array 'dialog::_modified' is not used any more.
• improvements to Alpha 8/tk support of dnd, set... etc.
• added shell for 'file mtime name val' support, but need to fill in
  an appleevent implementation.
• improved the 'build distribution' dialog using newly added 'date'
  dialog type.
• improved Tcl mode's debug/apply changes functionality, esp in dump
  error info traces.

================================================================================
= 7.5d27 released			   		   last update: 09/05/2001 {15:40:51 PM}
================================================================================
• made sure macros package doesn't rename stuff twice.
• added list of file/dir patterns to ignore when building 'from
  hierarchy' filesets.  Added to Ftp Menu Help.
• 'saveAs -f' will now throw an error if given a filename with illegal
  characters (use file::makeNameLegal if required)
• bunch of fixes from Craig
• fixed small Tcl 8 bug in Tcl func parsing.
• fix for comment paragraph wrapping.
• fixed quote::Insert (thanks Dominique)
• added 'make' mode to go along with make menu
• added new 'isIn.tcl' from Bernard and Joachim -- thanks!  This means
  we _will_ need to add some new mode variables to a lot of modes --
  please contribute to the modes you use!  I made the suggested
  changes to Tcl, C, C++, Perl, TeX, Text, Mail and HTML modes
• variety of fixes to paragraph filling.
• fix to copyRing (thanks Dominique)
• added 'Tclextensions' directory where users can install Tcl
  extensions which they can't (or don't want to) apply to the main
  Tcl distributions (only useful for Alpha 8/X/tk).

================================================================================
= 7.5d26 released			   		   last update: 08/29/2001 {11:05:26 AM}

• bunch of updates to examples, help, man mode, setext mode (thanks Craig)
• removed some debugging code.
• updates to macro package
• added Maple mode -- thanks Joachim.
• small fix to floatNamedMarks
• updated ftpMenu.
• auto-marking of dividers in help files improved.

================================================================================

================================================================================
• fixed installer after 'changes' button issues (Craig)
• small fix to latex filesets.
• fix to specialCharacters package, and mark alpha commands.
• cosmetic dialog improvements (thanks Johan) -- I think this is
  everything from the alphatcl-developers list, but I might have
  missed something -- please tell me!

================================================================================
= 7.5d24 released			   		   last update: 08/20/2001 {10:11:09 AM}
================================================================================
• various fixes from Craig, Dominique (thanks)
• removed extra Filters folder from Packages directory -- caused by
  buggy Setx installer.
• added some support for Alphatk do postscript mode.
• new ftpMenu with more flexible/secure password handling (thanks Johan)
• lots of dialog improvements (thanks Johan)
• installer should now work on Alpha 7
• added timezone handling to 'mtime' (thanks Johan)

================================================================================
= 7.5d23 released			   		   last update: 08/16/2001 {18:37:07 PM}
================================================================================
• further improvements to distribution maker.
• better yes/no dialog when there is huge amounts of text.
• updates to Alpha Commands TclCompletions, AlphaDeveloperMenu and tclMode
  (thanks Craig)
• improved date::isOlder
• temporary file cleanup can no longer throw an error, and works
  correctly with a hierarchy of temporary files.
• renamed "Mode Examples" to "Examples" and made appropriate changes
  in AlphaTcl.
• added partial implementation of 'clock' for Alpha 7 in oldClock.tcl 
  -- if anyone wants to improve this, please do so!  It would be good
  to embed most of the 'mtime' functionality in 'clock format'.
• removed date::isOlder; should use 'clock scan' now.
• updated Bib, Perl and Setx modes (thanks Craig)

================================================================================
= 7.5d22 released			   		   last update: 08/13/2001 {18:09:20 PM}
================================================================================
• newPref doesn't require the 'mode' variable to be set (solves
  package rebuilding error with tclAE package)
• small improvements to man mode.
• beginnings of enhancements to app:: procedures.  In particular a new
  app::execute which is much easier to use than app::runScript. 
  Several new procedures aeapp:: have been created which will be used
  specifically to deal with built-in support for AE communication with
  applications.  This differs from app:: which does not necessarily
  require apple-events (e.g. in Alpha X or Alphatk)
• added '-changes' flag to the installation dialog, and improved the
  automated distribution maker to use it.
• both install::editHook and install::openHook examine the install
  script for dangerous code before sourcing.
• updated mac menu.
• improvements to bibEngine.tcl for Alphatk, and enhanced bib mode
  so index is rebuilt if it is out of date.  Code should now work
  well with Alphatk/X.
• better dealing with Alpha-Alphatk differences in help menu and 
  readme at startup.  Also Bernard's 'Images' directory removed from menu.
• renamed PostscriptHelp.html to "Postscript Help.html" so we only
  get one menu entry.
• install::fromRemoteUrl can find the resulting install file more
  easily; added file::tryToFindInFolder

================================================================================
= 7.5d21 released			   		   last update: 08/10/2001 {10:49:26 AM}

================================================================================
= 7.5d20 released			   		   last update: 08/08/2001 {12:47:43 PM}
================================================================================
• added temp::cleanupAll which is called at startup to remove any 
  temporary files which may have been left behind when AlphaTcl last
  quit (or crashed).
• moved filters menu and Filters folder into its own directory in the
  Menus directory.  Required minor changes to filtersMenu.tcl and help
  file.
• slightly better comments for tabSize and indentationAmount
• small fixes to dialogsNew.tcl and menus.tcl
• added support for '-tails' flag to glob ('-tails' is new in Tcl 8.4).  
  The changes were quite minor, but this does need testing.  This
  means that strictly speaking 'glob -t' is now an error because it
  is ambiguous; the correct option is '-types'.  The code currently 
  accepts '-t' when using Tcl 8.3 or newer, but any code using '-t' 
  will fail in Tcl 8.4 (there are three locations in HTML mode which 
  have been modified to fix this problem).  Support for '-t' will be
  removed completely in a subsequent release.
• added a safety check on startup for correct loading.
• added '-shrink' flag to 'new'
• some startup error messages (e.g. when init'ing packages) are now
  postponed until after startup since the act of displaying the error
  can actually lead to more errors if AlphaTcl isn't sufficiently inited.
  There is a new procedure 'alpha::evaluateWhenGuiIsReady' which can be
  used for such purposes (it is called by package::throwActivationError)
• updated mode creation assistant
• updated postscript mode (various help files installed need some
  renaming/rearrangement)
• added simple versions of 'file separator', 'file system' and 
  'file normalize' to Alpha 7.
• fix to 'file dirname' to avoid infinite directory recursion.
• added another startup robustness check for problem which can arise
  when you corrupt the package indices.
• added better support for entire AlphaTcl libraries to be read-only, 
  or mounted from a single archive vfs (works in Alphatk now)
• made some improvements to "Extending Alpha"

================================================================================
= 7.5d19 released			   		   last update: 07/30/2001 {10:06:22 AM}
================================================================================

  AlphaTcl's home directory.
• fixes to installer (thanks Johan)
• file::convertLineEndings added (thanks Johan)
• fix to setup assistant.

================================================================================
= 7.5d18 released			   		   last update: 07/27/2001 {16:56:39 PM}
================================================================================
• fixes to some navigation procedures in latex mode (thanks Juan)
• fix for newPref with backslash-newline continuations, and
  modification to 'parseWords' to handle a backslash new-line as well.
• small improvement to cvs system.
• fix to doPrefixText for Alphatk
• changed menu binding for Alphatk of uncomment line.
• fix for 'file rename' in Alpha 7 to avoid destroying resource fork
  (thanks Frédéric), requires change to file::absolutePath, and
  addition of file::move.
• small improvement to latex mode marking.
• the Packages menu 'install a package' has support for entry of a 
  directory url.  This works for ftp, http urls now (at least in Alphatk).
• added url::contents, url::isDirectory and url::directoryContents
• updated Perl mode and electric completions (thanks Craig).
• added file::toUrl used by dialogs and url code.
• corrected typo in setup assistant, and made alpha developer items
  off by default.  That way the users who just click on the default
  will get a more sensible setup.
• added word bindings for Alphatk
• some improved help files.
• removed some saveAs work-arounds from global::listPackages.
• the newFileset procedure is now responsible for asking the user
  whether to save a fileset; this simplifies all ::create procedures,
  and allows AlphaTcl to keep track of which filesets are temporary
  and which not.
• changed sequence on quit from 'save prefs then call quitHooks' to
  'call quitHooks then save prefs'.  This allows quit hooks to adjust
  preferences, which seems sensible.  Removed support for
  'modifiedModeVars' variable which has been obsolete for some time.
  'modifiedArrVars' too.  All access to prefs should
  be through prefs:: functions.  This involves changes to matlabMode,
  macros, docProjects, recentFilesMulti, voodooEvents and
  internetConfigMenu, and a variety of system files.
• prefsHandling.tcl is now completely standalone in AlphaTcl.  Any use
  of the 'modifiedXXX' variables is deprecated.
• improvements to user details and doc projects from Frédéric
• fixed bug in 'open via fileset' with recurse in folder and latex
  filesets.
• fix to ftp code as result of file join changes.
• moved HTML and LaTeX help into the Help directory.
• added improved latex1 <-> macroman filters.
• improved C++ func marking for Alphatk ('.*' is bad in search regexps).
• small ftp menu fixes for Alphatk.
• improved installer which can handle hierarchies of files
• added to alpha developer menu an ability to create a distribution
  (needs more work).

• various file join/ftp fixes
• added text::surroundingWord
• fix to file::read/writeAll for Alpha 8/tk
• fix for filesets menu hidden/deleted items reappearing on startup in
  Alpha 7/8 (but we should try to fix deleteMenuItem for Alpha 8 anyway).
• updated Frontier menu, setup assistant improved (thanks Johan)
• lots of electric fixes (thanks Craig)
• minor fix to gnuplot mode.
• added 'save a copy at' to the ftp menu.
• better C/C++/Rez marking

• small fix to htmlCheckLinks.tcl for Alphatk.
• view/remove saved settings can now handle multiple items.
• tex filesets cope with \input names with spaces instead of braces.
• various tex marking, etc improvements for Alphatk ('.*' replaced by
  appropriate search pattern)
• various vfs fileset improvements.
• errors when opening a file through 'file::openAny' are not passed on
  to the caller any more.
• lots of changes from Jon:
• ftpMenu.tcl: support for ODB edited files ("Edit in BBEdit") in Alpha 8
• browserMode.tcl: support for multi-line entries
• cMode.tcl: function color default is magenta (to match the actual color it
  has always been (once I fixed the yellow definition, my source files
  became unreadable)).
• diffMode.tcl: <opt><up|down-arrow> moves to prev|next file in multi-file diffs
• igorMode.tcl: added .ipf file appendage and 'IGR0' creator
• latexMenu.tcl: "Untitled" -> "untitled"
• contextual.tcl: CM support for Alpha 8
• odbEditor.tcl: "Edit in BBEdit" support for Alpha 8
• aebuild.tcl: default 'null'() object in tclAE::build::propertyObject
• aeom.tcl: aevt/odoc hook (distinct from openHook) to support ODB Editor suite.
• www.tcl: more capable url::parseFtp
• initAlphaTcl.tcl: hiding Alpha 8 dialog definitions
• initTcl.tcl: tclLog and namespace_exists fixes
• menus.tcl: cyan fix
• prefsHandling.tcl: root namespace fix
• vcsCore.tcl: absence of VCS system changed back to "None"

================================================================================
• fix to setup assistant and international menus problems introduced in d13
• added beginningOfLineSmart
• added 'Install A Package' to packages menu, which will allow the
  user to input a url and then attempt to download and install that
  package (e.g. copy url from alphatcl-developer list into the dialog,
  and you should have a one-step way to test any new package).
• added Bernard's PHP mode.
• fixed Perl comment char.
• fix to installer checking for new packages (it checked for modes as
  well as features, which was not necessary).
• added support for file: urls to url::fetch, and url::store
• added 'namespace eval ftp' to www.tcl (thanks Craig)

================================================================================
= 7.5d13 released			   		   last update: 05/02/2001 {18:02:23 PM}
================================================================================
• Added partial support to dialogs code for new '-dnd' flag which will
  allow dropping of suitable items into Alpha's non-modal dialogs (e.g. drop a
  folder onto a search path, drag a piece of text into a search
  dialog).  Parsing of the '-dnd' flag to the 'dialog' command has been 
  partly added to Alphatk and will be added to Alpha 8 in the future.
• fix to help::hyperiseUrls and installer.  Also installer has only
  one copy of supersearch now.
• added 'win::CountFor'
• fixed to dialog::getUrl, redefintion of icUrl and the requirements
  failed handling (thanks Johan).
• removed opt-Q binding from Tcl menu.
• moved option-backspace/delete to core from emacs package.  These
  delete entire words.  Changed gotoLine binding to control-option-G.
• added switchTo and macMenu to setup assistant (for MacOS, anyway),
  we'll have to work out what to do here if macMenu doesn't work
  properly with OS 7 (but presumably by the time 7.5 final is released
  it will work).
• small fix to latest smartPaste for Alphatk, and documentation of the
  issue in "Extending Alpha".
• fix for lost package 'requirements' information on quit.
• small improvements to mode creator, and man mode.
• added basic safety check to install::openHook

================================================================================

================================================================================
• Added helpful comments on ::correctIndentation to mode assistant.
• removed 'blah' from ftpMenu (sorry, that was there to test start up
  error handling).
• made default for emacs package in setup assistant 'off'.
• remove start up problems when listing packages.
• removed option-space binding from systemcode; it's in the emacs
  package for those who need it.  If you leave the emacs package off, 
  the core of Alpha now contains no option-only bindings except opt-g,
  opt-tab and those defined by your international menus settings.
• large number of changes from Jon for better HIG compliance, including:
• Dialog rearrangements, including putting buttons on the correct side 
  of the dialog. Better layout of supersearch.
• "Untitled" -> "untitled" to comply with HIG.
• Variations on "cancel" error messages made consistent so they're 
  caught in Alpha 8.
• Better treatment of option-titlebar click in C mode.
• VOODOO Menu tweaks.
• Fort::indentLine bug fix.

• Chng mode marking copes with Changes - Alphatk file layout.
• added support for Alphatk's '-l' flag to 'dialog' to the dialogs
  code for use by SearchPath items.  Used in javaMode.
• fix to prefs::tclAddLine; remove obsolete code from electric menu
• Tcl mode's parseFuncs and marking can now handle procedures whose
  arguments span multiple lines (e.g. dialogs.tcl now correctly
  marked with Tcl 8).
• installer will remove supersearch from Packages.
• fix to mode::features change in dialogs.tcl (thanks Johan).
• colour headings etc, now hypers "# Marks".
• implementation of 'requirements' block in AlphaTcl package
  declarations.  Items which fail this are removed from the various
  selection dialogs, and will be listed separately at the end of the
  "Packages" help file.  If you wish to force a package on, you can
  simply use 'alpha::package require xxx' at present, although we
  may remove that option...  See rememberWindows or windowsMenuFixes
  for how to use the option.
• removed obsolete procs from emacs package.
• small changes to Bug Reports and Debugging readme.
• used versions of bind::CarriageReturn and bind::continueComment 
  reported to alpha-bugzilla. (thanks Joachim). 
• removed 'refresh' from win::searchAndHyperise to speed up marking
  of help files.
• updated keyword list in perl mode.
• removed 'sorted is default' flag which is no longer used in either
  AlphaTcl or the core of Alpha.
• lots of small fixes from Craig.
• removed 'quietly clear marks' flag, since it was pretty useless.

================================================================================

================================================================================
• global::_varMem only referenced in alphaHooks; other users go
  through the helper procedures.
• lots of small fixes from Craig.  Installer will auto-install again.
• starting up while skipping preferences will work properly (without
  any startup errors), and will ask before overwriting your old
  preferences when you quit.
• moved supersearch to CorePackages since it's required by Alphatk and
  it won't startup when skipping prefs if its in Packages.
• made sure to update AlphaTcl version number this time, and add
  correct first line to install script.
• installer will also rebuild standard filesets and the Packages Help
  file when sensible.
• app::registerMultiple no longer forces its menu into the menu bar
  when it is called.  It checks first to see whether the menu is
  already inserted.  This is a behaviour change, but the proc was
  never documented to do what it did anyway.  This means the ftp
  menu no longer forces itself into the menu bar too early.
• prefs of type 'SearchPath' can now take an optional argument which
  allows a search path to contain files (matching the patterns given) 
  as well as directories.  This is useful for, say, Java class paths
  which can contain .jar or .zip files.  See "javaMode.tcl" for an
  example of such a declaration.  We really need to enhance 'getfile' 
  so it will only show files matching the given patterns to make full
  use of this feature.  (Alphatk contains this enhancement)
• newer marks.tcl from Craig, with some modifications so works in
  Alphatk.
• tcl mode marking handles separators.

= 7.5d9 released			   		   last update: 04/13/2001 {12:28:28 PM}
================================================================================
• moved mark stack implementation into its own file.
• more ellipses in menus.
• removed variable 'reverting' which doesn't seem to be used, and
  variable 'lastMode' is no longer global, since it isn't used.
• slightly better auto-marking of "Tcl Commands"
• updated reg/regPart procs in supersearch package.
• new twiddle words implementation (thanks Mark)
• use of Apple's html viewer is governed by tcl_platform, not alpha::platform
• smart paste changes so hopefully completely independent of copy ring
  package (needs testing).
• bib to html works in Alphatk, also changed to avoid calling html
  mode code.
• bib mode updated to always contain a conversions menu.
• text::indentBy slightly better for Alphatk
• startup problem with missing temporary menu features has been fixed 
  (e.g. when you upgrade Alpha under some circumstances).

================================================================================
= 7.5d8 released			   		   last update: 04/10/2001 {12:04:14 PM}
================================================================================
• better BackCompatibility.tcl
• small improvements to ftp menu help file.
• put 'saveAs' fix in coreFixes.tcl, so 'saveAs -f foo' will work as
  expected.
• added some '…' to menu items (including in backup package).
• diskModifiedHook (and registered hooks) take an additional argument 
  which is the difference in modification date between the existing
  window and the file on disk.  This means we now notice when a file
  has been replaced by an older version (previously only newer
  versions were noticed). (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY* since
  registered hook procedures must take an additional arugment)

================================================================================
= 7.5d1-d7 changes in addition to 7.4.2
================================================================================
• updated to newer mac menu
• better 'file' implementation for Alpha 7, glob fix (thanks Johan).

================================================================================
= 7.4.2 released			   		   last update: 04/08/2001 {15:00:26 PM}
================================================================================
(Note: most changes backported from 7.5 development branch (d1-d7))
• insert/remove-Menu can take multiple arguments
• small fix for int/float problems in win.tcl tiling procedures.
• setup assistant won't rebuild packages help when called manually.
• turned ... into ellipsis in openWindowsMenu package.
• added an example func/parseExpr to the mode creation assistant
• last minor fix to twiddle for emacs-like behaviour.
• better wintiled.
• prompts fix for spacebar
• further mode assistant fixes and warning for pre-existing file.
• added Italian-Pro keyboard support to AlphaTcl and latex accents
  package.
• modification date unchanged by installer line-endings fixing.
• modified twiddle to handle selection differently a la Mark.
• added new postscript mode, and new windows menu, and moved the
  windows menu related code into its own file as its own package,
  called 'Open Windows Menu' which is always on.  This makes the code
  almost completely independent of the rest of AlphaTcl.
• improved dialogs in various elec packages, and new bibtex mode, also
  various modified help files.
• filesets menu no longer forces itself into the menubar early on in
  the startup process.
• small supersearch error message improvement when file doesn't exist.
• added 'uninstall' function which can be used to help remove Alpha
  completely from a system.
• tip mode changed default 'tip' sites to dev.scriptics.com because of
  recent DNS problems with old site.
• small fix to doc-projects and cancel.
• ftp menu fix.
• some small improvements to tcl-tk menu of tcl mode.
• brws mode slightly better in 'dynamic' mode.
• added 'Preview Backup' option to 'Revert To Backup' in the backup
  package (it would be nice to add multiple emacs-style backups too).
• small update to "FTP menu help", and Fileset Ftp Mirror package.
• added 'selectLimits'
• Tcl::markFile handles duplicates better.
• update to HTML/CSS Modes 3.1
• small improvements/fixes to mode creation assistant.
• added 'file::minimalDistinctTails' which is used by the recent files
  multi-menu and dialog::findApp
• renamed 'use status bar' to 'use status bar for prompts'
• renamed a bunch of 'Alpha-D' references to 'alphatcl-developers'.
• new pref 'texable file extensions' in latex mode.
• updated license information in some files (Tcl/BSD license
  added in general).
• small macros fix
• added the impressive new "mac menu" (thanks Bernard)
• switch prompts code to use 'tab' to complete, and double-tab to
  go to a list-pick dialog, also made code a bit more obvious
  in its function.  (*** BEHAVIOUR CHANGE ***)
• fixed checks for shadowing of global vars with mode vars.  New
  procedures in alphaHooks.tcl to check for shadowing and read/set
  shadowed variables.  This bug was re-introduced in 7.2b2, after
  previously being fixed in the early 7.0a3 release.
• replaced all 'stripNameCount' by 'win::StripCount'.
• revamped some of the application finding code in dialogs and
  appPaths.tcl, mostly for improved behaviour in Alphatk, but also to
  add better prompts to the dialogs - this needs good testing on
  Alpha 7.x
• couple of file:: fixes from Craig.
• updated alpha developer menu from Craig (which is much nicer than
  the old one!); required small change to Tcl mode too.
• updated url in setup assistant for mailing list subscription.
• fix to renamed proc in latex filesets (thanks!)
• save a copy as... fix.
• prompt::statusLineComplete updated so it won't do automatic
  completion unless asked.  May still need some more work.  Use
  'ctrl-w' to force completion. (*** BEHAVIOUR CHANGE ***)
• 'evaluate' now takes an optional string argument, which it evaluates
  instead of looking for a selection (if given).
• fix to macros package.
• very simple 'man' mode for editing unix man pages.
• added support for latest cmactex version, and various other
  additions to latexComm.tcl.  Version of LaTeX mode now 4.9.0
• couple of minor fixes to HTML mode for Alphatk
• better version of fileset::isIn, using fileset::getBaseDirectory
  when appropriate.
• comment::(undo)Paragraph select the result.
• fix to 'file copy' (sorry for bug in 7.5d1!).
• updated help (esp wrt new mailing lists) - thanks Craig.
• Macros package updated.
• wrap-fix to python mode mark file.
• fix to status prompt completion code for items with embedded spaces,
  and some similar fixes for problems with lists vs non-lists.
• supersearch gives warning for multi replace all when not triggered
  from the dialog.  You can use 'replaceAll 1' to avoid the warning.
• suffix mappings prefs saving fix.
• fix to option titlebar default proc when current win is selected.
• removed the include-descriptions-in-dialogs flag, since it only
  causes visual problems.
• added Bib mode paragraph definition.
• fix to winReadOnly when not the front window
• proper "Mail Help" file now included.
• line indentation can now be globally handled by the ::indentLine
  procedure which can make use of a mode's 'correctIndentation' proc.
  This means modes need not define their own indentLine procedure
  any more.  There is a new preference as to where the cursor should 
  end up after indentation, which is global ('position after
  indentation').
• fix to getBSRText in TeX mode.
• filesets fix from Lars.
• C mode indentation fix for ::
• sentence region fix from Giovanni.
• added ellipsis to 'text to alpha'
• fix to comment::undoLine, fix to alpha::actionOnFileScript
• updated metafont mode to 2.0
• changes to smartPaste/copyRing to remove some dependencies
• moved html Url escaping functions to core.
• feature (de)activation errors are presented to the user and do not
  result in changes to the various feature lists.
• removed support for obsolete commentCharacters($mode:General); the
  correct version is $mode::commentCharacters.  Matlab mode needed
  updating.  Various modes updated so they set the proper comment
  characters and paragraph start/finish expressions.
• added backup of defs.tcl and arrdefs.tcl and code to handle them
  if they get corrupted (can happen if Alpha(tk) is force-quit during
  exit).
• added basic implementation of '-force' flag to 'file copy' on Alpha 7
• fixed a bug when using the 'edit a filesets' dialog and the embedded
  attach/detach information button.  Also added support for groups of
  attached information to each fileset, as used by the new 'fileset ftp
  mirror' package.  Added support for read-only 'text' fields to new
  dialogs code.
• Mark's version of doPrefix.
• new pref 'twiddle preference' which switches between various people's
  desired behaviour.  Default behaviour changed (*** BEHAVIOUR CHANGE ***)
• copied ftpMkDir and ftp mirroring code from html mode to www.tcl,
  trying to make the code independent of html mode.  The 'fileset ftp
  mirror' package has some chance of working now.
• improved 'stuff' and 'open folder' fileset operations.
• added success message to 'procs::loadEnclosing'.
• added to "Filesets Help" file.
• sendOpenEvents partly implemented for non-macintosh platforms.
• much faster preference saving.
• better error messages in www code when using Tcl's ftp package.
• added 'fileset::exists'
• installer will do 'remove' actions first.

================================================================================
= 7.4.1 released			   		   last update: 08/02/2001 {19:50:03 PM}
================================================================================
• Fixed a startup error when rebuilding the package indices.
• Added rudimentary help to those packages completely missing help.
• Some updates in the Alpha Manual. (thanks Craig)
• Removed the packages "Notes" and "Windows menu fixes".
• "Revert to backup" is now enabled when it should be.

Summary of most obvious behavioural changes since 7.3 (there are of
course huge numbers of fixes, additions which are not so obvious):

Setup assistant on startup to help new users configure Alpha.

'Edit Filesets' dialog added, allowing all of your filesets and
their related preferences (and new 'attached' information) to
be edited from one place.

The default key binding for "electric completion" has been changed to 
ctrl-tab. It was previously cmd-tab. The change was made to avoid the 
conflict with Mac OS's program switcher.

Improved interactive search, which allows 'delete' to remove
one character from the search (and move to the previous match).
Note that a side-effect of this is that clicking the mouse no-longer
aborts the search.  There are various new key-shortcuts too
(e.g. ctrl-i switches case-insensitivity of the search, ctrl-w extends
search to next word, ctrl-s ctrl-s continues the last search.)

Much 'Alpha Developer' functionality moved to a new menu, separate
from the Tcl menu.

Lots of improved documentation (well worth a read).

• bibtex fix so bibtexMode.tcl is always loaded first, plus
  index->database fix.

  that if Alpha(tk) is moved, these still work correctly.  These all
  use a new procedure alpha::actionOnFileScript
• some filesets fixes ('Choose' menu is updated).
• ada mode minor changes.

================================================================================
= 7.4fc2 released			   		last update: 12/19/2000 {10:31:43 AM}
================================================================================
• removed <S from rebuild all filesets
• workaround for addMenuItem problem in ftp menu (thanks Martin)

• various fixes from Alpha-D list (mostly Dominique -- thanks).

  length of any hyperised text.
• ftpMenu gives a reasonable error msg if the ftp operation failed
  when creating ftp filesets.
• fix to supersearch and filesets containing directories.
• added status::msg as synonym for message (message is in Tk so we
  probably want to move away from using it in the future).
• fileManipulation.tcl has better error messages
• various fileset 'attached information' fixes.
• iCab added to alphaDefinitions.tcl

================================================================================
= 7.4fc1 released			   		last update: 12/08/2000 {11:44:26 AM}
================================================================================
• filesets menu fix with new procedural filesets.
• simplified resumeHook, avoiding dubious global variables.  Updated
  spellcheck, codewarrior code to use hooks instead.
• fixed problems in recentFilesMultiMenu when you delete filesets.  The
  menu now detects this and removes those recent files groups.
• updated stats modes and bibtex mode (+ helpers) from Craig.  Thanks!
• further improvements to "Bug Reports and Debugging"
• added file::openAsTemplate
• updated electric corrections.
• fix to mode search paths.
• lots of modified help files (thanks Craig).
• www.tcl forces ae code to load in Alpha 7, hopefully helping to
  prevent some timeout issues.  Also reduced Fetch timeout.
• pascal mark file (thanks Craig), also various fixes to help files,
  and alphaDefinitions from Craig and Johan.
• updated ftpMenu.
• added recursive searching to tex mode.
• simplified help menu code a little bit, after renaming MacPerl,
  Macros help files.
• lots of fixes from Dominique and Craig (thanks!).
• moved tclae init out of thinkMenu init and into code which is only
  used if think menu is actually active (else bug on Alphatk).
• better java mode marking.
• updated setext mode, lots of updated help text for modes, packages
  (thanks Craig), updated mark procs.
• updated lisp, scheme modes (moved mutual require into bodies of
  files, to avoid startup issues).
• thinkMenu error message if no Think
• temp::path improvement.
• numerous help text additions (thanks Donavan)
• various changes/fixes to filesetsMenu, ftpMenu.
• docprojects fix, sql upper improvements, gplt additions.
• various filesets, ftp, filesetsMenu changes to simplify and unify
  the various update/make/rebuild codes.  This now means 'rebuild all
  filesets' does just that (and therefore will take rather longer than
  before).  It also required changes to each fileset type
  (codewarrior, think, tex, etc...).  Please test thoroughly!
• better prefs menu and bugfix when there is nothing in package::prefs
• more help text and help files (thanks!).

================================================================================
= 7.4b23 released			   		last update: 11/28/2000 {16:27:17 PM}
================================================================================
• added messages to change mode marking.
• better instructions in "Bug Reports and Debugging"
• renamed win::isReady to winCreatedHook and moved it to
  alphaHooks.tcl, since it is called by Alpha's internals, similary
  renamed file::preOpeningCheck to filePreOpeningHook and moved to
  alphaHooks.tcl.  Also documented exactly when they should be called.
• new oserrors.tcl

================================================================================
= 7.4b22 released			   		last update: 11/27/2000 {12:00:28 PM}
================================================================================
• dialog::getUrl is a little better; added url::browserWindow
  (hopefully works on MacOS and Windows)
• changed Suncompiler sig to javc in javaMode.tcl
• improved text::isInComment for C /* ... */ comments.
• file::showInFinder handles directories as well as files 
  (openFolder now obsolete).
• few simplifications, fixes to dialogs, help code.
• html viewing preference made extensible; moved some code to www.tcl.
• changed a lot of newPref statements to reflect the proper type
  ('sig', 'color', etc).  In the future we may remove the automatic 
  typing of preferences based on name, which would streamline a lot of
  the dialogs code.
• various debugging/procs improvements.
• improved TIP mode.
• still allow Tcl exit with one optional argument in renamed version.
• added quote::Unurl to invert what quote::Url does.
• changed all 'glob -t' to 'glob -types' to avoid possible ambiguity
  with later versions of glob and '-tails'.
• updated mode::getVar
• more updates from Jon, esp. to AETcl code.
• small fix to mailMenu.tcl (thanks)
• latex, modeSearchPaths improvements.
• renamed hidden array file::config to win::config since it works for 
  both file and non-file windows, added procs win::setInitialMode,
  win::setInitialConfig, win::isReady

================================================================================
= 7.4b21 released			   		last update: 11/13/2000 {10:31:35 AM}
================================================================================
• added proc: quote::Url and proc: url::mailto
• improvements to TIP mode; uses quote::Url to pass on mailto's with
  the body already setup.
• small fixes to alphaDeveloperMenu, elecCorrections
• put in more conventional app:: calls for spell checking, adds
  possibility of cross platform support.
• minor change to the version package
• parse '{}' popup added to Igor mode
• VOODOO menu fixes for TclAE
• Added "Copy File To Distribution…" to alpha developer menu
• More TclAE compatibility fixes
• some minor fixes to gnuplot mode.  The code hasn't been touched for
  a long time; it would be good to get it working with latest gnuplot
  on both Alpha and Alphatk.
• added 'dialog::getUrl' to dialogs.tcl, and added new 'newPref' type 
  'url', which is used by Tcl, TIP, stats modes, etc.
• mailMenu works with mailto url specification, hopefully cross-platform.
  (mailMenu supercedes 'eudoraMenu').
• fixed problem when a mode's preferences ask for a package which no
  longer exists.
• quote::Url handles empty strings.
• eudoraMenu replaced by mailMenu which provides some level of
  abstraction away from pure Eudora support.  Eudora help file
  replaced by "Mail Help"

================================================================================
= 7.4b20 released			   		last update: 11/06/2000 {20:56:57 PM}
================================================================================
• made 'titlebar' with 'fetched' work cross-platform
• addition of python mode (thanks Howard Oakley)
• changed default of warning obsolete procedures to 0
• replacing of a file by a directory is now supported in the installer
  (the file is backed up, if desired)
• added some support for other 'edit actions' than actually editing
  the file.  Only activated for Tcl 8.0 or newer (but see coreFixes.tcl 
  to turn it on for Alpha 7).  This allows, for instance, the
  installer, to avoid opening the unwanted window (and moving it
  offscreen).  Also allows Alphatk/8 to edit files hidden inside
  virtual file systems.
• 'open via fileset' on hierarchical filesets now presents a dialog
  which allows exploring up and down the hierarchy, rather than simply
  listing all files in the fileset.
• when a file is opened which uses the 'unixMode' array to specify its
  mode, the unixModeHook is called, to allow specific application
  dependent actions to take place.
• small fix to procUtils.tcl
• addition of debug/applyChanges to Tcl menu.
• various odd fixes to filesets and fileManipulation code.
• addition of TIP mode for editing Tcl Improvement Proposals.
• fixed couple of bugs in the mode creation assistant (which, having
  just used it, is actually very cool: much to be recommended!)

================================================================================
= 7.4b19 released			   		last update: 10/30/2000 {15:31:13 PM}

• added some ae procs to BackCompatibility.tcl
• various fixes from Jon to help with new tclAE code.

================================================================================
= 7.4b18 released			   		last update: 10/30/2000 {11:37:28 AM}
================================================================================
• small fix to filters menu
• fixes to eudoraMenu (expr/pos::math/minPos etc), prompt::fromChoices
  used in three places, mailTab fixed.
• help::openFile used in codewarrior, internet config menus.
• AlphaTcl warns the user of duplicate mode definitions when
  rebuilding indices (e.g. this would have noticed the original 'b9'
  problems).
• ftp commands more robust (esp. with Tcl ftp package).
• Craig's 'help' improvements added, includes changes to some help
  files, and help.tcl
• removed use of many deprecated procedures from ftpMenu.tcl, help.tcl,
  etc.
• addition of temp.tcl in CorePackages, used by ftp menu.
• small fix to tex mode temporary files, and uses temp.tcl
• added 'warning for obsolete procedures' to alpha developer menu
• some vc systems use the temp.tcl stuff.
• fix to alpha's www faq.tcl
• ftpMenu's cache copes better with files of same name, but different
  location.

================================================================================

• small fix to filters menu
• many changes from Jon, mostly for Alpha 8.

• better handling of examples.

================================================================================
= 7.4b16 released			   		last update: 10/19/2000 {13:13:14 PM}
================================================================================
• prompt::statusLineComplete etc work properly in Alpha 8/tk, I think
• file::renameTo handles errors
• added 'Uhr' to isoTime pacakge to fix problems there.
• added code to installer to attempt to fix line-endings of any .tcl
  files which are installed.  This should help to avoid unfortunate
  startup errors for users who haven't configured stuffit/ic
  appropriately.
• more sensible tclHelp lookup procedure in Alpha 8/tk (no %).  Renamed
  variable to make things clearer.
• proper fix to returnToBookmark etc.
• update to Filesets Help.
• small fixes (pos::math/expr) to eudora mode for Alphatk
• added prefs::renameOld to allow extension authors to rename things
  without inconveniencing users.
• added 'prompt::fromChoices', and 'completion::fromChoices' to allow
  simplification of some old sPromptChoices, choicesProc etc.  This
  means close/chooseAWindow now benefit from automatic completion,
  and also implicitly use the 'useStatusBar' flag.  Also implies that
  the 'status' only procs can be obsoleted.  Side-effect is that
  cmd-; now obeys the 'useStatusBar' flag to decide whether to use
  status bar or a listpick dialog.  Made default value of
  'useStatusBar' 0.
• general replacement of stripNameCount by win::StripCount
• added support in dialogs code for get_directory with a starting
  point (only supported in Alphatk at present).
• alpha::reportError gives choice of viewing the stack dump.
• addition of elecCorrections, and menus to elecCompletions/Expansions
• updated manipCols, filtersMenu
• all *tutorial files are placed in Completions directory by
  installer.
• helpMenu strips extensions and hence is closer to supporting other
  actions on non-Text help items.  Help items with a .tcl extension
  are assumed to be Tcl scripts which are sourced (and can therefore
  perform arbitrary actions).
• split AlphaTcl startup process into separate files for finer grained 
  control by editor.  Allows Alpha/tk to load 'early' preferences much
  earlier in the startup process.
• improved parseWords handles [], ensuring correct help text is 
  extracted.
• updated bibtex mode and associated packages (thanks Craig)
• added 'Tests' directory, for general files useful for testing. 
  Installer knows about this directory.
• better C++ marking.
• made auto_load, procs::find and startup more robust to problems.
  (plus of course fixed the bad problems introduced in trying to
  split the startup process into two pieces).
• better C++ marking (again)

================================================================================
= 7.4b15 released			   		last update: 09/26/2000 {09:47:00 AM}

• Suffix Mappings dialog changes width based on screen width, and
  increases height of longer entries.
• Added brief help to 'compare windows', 'bib to html' packages.
• 'modeExamplesScript.tcl' is obsolete.
• Moved lots of 'file::hyperOpenXXX' procs to 'help::openXXX'
• Replaced some references to procs in BackCompatibility.tcl
• Added proc is::List, and made use of it in suffixMappings dialog;
  prevents user from entering bad pattern lists which would lead to
  errors on opening files.
• Removed cadr/caddr/cadddr etc from ftpMenu
• better menu dimming in alpha dev menu
• funcs menu in Tcl includes duplicates with '1 of 2', '2 of 2' etc.
• moved search-hyperising procs to win:: namespace (from file::)
• removed caveat from Quick Start help file; Alpha can be installed in
  any directory, ever since the 'glob' changes (i.e. since 7.2.1b3).
• two fixes to www.tcl from bugzilla (thanks).
• additions to Tcl completions and electric left.

• updated Metafont mode (thanks Bernard)
• some additions to Tcl-process communication in tclMode.tcl

• addition of tcl version to packages list.
• fixed bibToRefer for Alphatk compatibility

  to how that code works to allow earlier mode/config recognition for
  files which are opened, and to have a clearer separation between
  things which happen for 'file' vs 'non-file' windows.  New procedure
  is 'file::preOpeningCheck', although 'win::FindMode' is the one
  you'll most likely want to use.
• better handling of mode extensions lists in package rebuilding.

• keyboard shortcuts in latex process menu changed (may change again
  if someone suggests a rational approach to redoing the menu).

• fix for FTP package upload when directory doesn't exist.
• proc: procs::findDefinition fix and simplification for Tcl 8.
• C,C++ marking fixed for Alphtk/Tcl 8 ('.*' is very greedy with new

  Alphatk-isms.
• minor doc projects fix
• manip cols package added (thanks Bernard), with some fixes for
  Alphatk.
• minor install mode fix (for cancelled installations)
• addition of proc: alphaOpen which should be used instead of 'open' where

  Alpha (e.g. the internal cache, package building code).
• bunch of small fixes from Johan (thanks).

• fix to setup assistant fileset creation
• all fileset changes from edit filesets dialog now saved on exit 
  (some changes were previously forgotten)
• moved couple of items in supersearch dialog so that it is clear
  which flags only apply to single file searches.  Also made
  multi-file search the default if the dialog is opened when no
  windows are present.
• small fileset fix (thanks Dominique)
• added 'edit a fileset' to avoid bug in Alpha 7's 'dialog' command.
• 'top window's folder' fileset now represents those files in the
  folder of the uppermost window which represents a file, so any tcl
  shells, batch search windows etc are ignored.
• in proc: Tcl::DblClick replaced \S regexp by [ \t] so it works with both
  Alpha 7.x and Tcl 8.
• better ftp fileset editing/saving, and updating.  Should work
  properly on Alpha 7,8 and tk, and with 'Edit Filesets' dialog.
• package preferences slightly rearranged to allow for editing of all 
  packages at once (thanks Dominique).
• electric menu automatically clears the cache when indices are
  rebuilt (added 'proc: cache::compareDates' to allow this).
• '.in' extensions are removed before checking for mode for a file.
  (typical makefile.in mkInstall.tcl.in configure.in on unix).
• simplified Alpha's "Readme", removing really old stuff.

================================================================================
= 7.4b4 released			   		last update: 05/21/2000 {00:23:44 AM}
================================================================================
• More vc fixes.
• fully implemented attaching of additional information to existing
  fileset information.  Now, for example, a fileset which uses cvs
  version control can have extra cvs specific information attached,
  and a fileset which doesn't won't have that information.
• "emacs.tcl" fixes (thanks Donavan)
• minor fix to proc: file::pathStartsWith
• proc: compare::files can take the names of the files (rather than asking) 
  as required by some vcs systems, and has a flag as to whether to 
  order the files by date or not.
• 'Local' version control system partly implemented.
• split "dialogs.tcl" into 3 files for more manageability
• vcs 'state' is now a string.  The ckid callback from Alpha 8
  translates the ckid code into a string which is passed to the vcs
  code.  cvs improvements.
• added up-to-date and needs-patch states to vcs system
• better proc: status::prompt in "alphaCommands.tcl" for Alpha 8.
• improvements to Diff mode, including some support for cvs style
  diffs.  A basic cvs diff should work now (not sure about patching,
  but at least highlighting the different sections).
• added more of Tom's Tcl/trace fixes/improvements.

• minor ftpParse fix in case user has a no username in ic.
• 'diff' capability partially implemented in vcCvs (but Diff mode
  doesn't yet handle a cvs-returned diff due to different header). 
  Other small vcs fixes/improvements, particularly for Alpha 8.
• Filled in password type in proc: dialog::make, used by ftp filesets now.
• minor fix to "ftpMenu.tcl" to avoid command: addMenuItem problems.

• final app::multi fix.
• various help files updated in minor ways.
• removed all codewarrior/ftp/think specific code from
  "filesetsMenu.tcl".  Each fileset type is now happy just by being
  registered.  better code separation between filesets and menu.
• added optional mapTo argument to 'proc: package::addPrefsDialog'
• open-windows-fileset 'type' fix (thanks).
• some changes to "search.tcl"/"tclMode.tcl" to better separate next/prevFunc
  functionality (some of Tom's new code).  Fix to Tcl mode
  func/parseExpr.

• proc: remoteEvaluate fix for Tcl 8.
• beginnings of "Version Control Help" file.
• supersearch gets initial state setup better with Tcl 8.
• various indentation related procedures work with a tab-size of 0
  (unusual case, but there were many problems).
• set tab size on open doesn't change the 'dirty' status of the window
• fix for 'proc: dialog::_tmp' problem.  Note that if proc: dialog::make fails
  internally due to some unforeseen error, you will be prompted to
  submit a bug report. 
• can auto-mark/colour help files if they are untouched.
• some Tcl example fixes in "Macros.help"
• updated "Filesets Help"

================================================================================
• proc: dialog::make works pretty well now, and I strongly suggest those
  writing their own dialogs using 'dialog' consider using dialog::make
  instead.  If you want any features added to dialog::make, alpha-d is 
  the right place to discuss such things.
• dialog::make argument list format changed to allow each dialog item 
  its own sublist (and hence allow optional arguments like help,
  perhaps even font size etc in the future).  The simple example is
  now:
    dialog::make -ok "Accept" -title hello -defaultpage Second \
    {First {var Hey 1} {flag blah 0} {Folder hey ""}} \
    {Second {var Hey 2} {password Pass abc}}
• 'uniq' etc. added to "fileUtils.tcl" (thanks Bernard)
• added help capability to proc: editFilesets and dialog::make, although it 
  is only used in Alpha 8/tk.
• Matlab mode largely modernised for Alpha 8/tk, similar efforts to
  Perl mode (both modes probably still contain problematic code).
• isearch/rsearch now can integrate with the standard search dialogs
  via cmd-e and/or ctrl-s,ctrl-s.
• fileset problem worked around, added 'preinit' capability for menus.
• install readme changed to 'READ.TO.INSTALL' so you can add a
  file-mapping in internet config to take it to Alpha's install-type
  automatically.  (Anything ending in INSTALL will trigger Inst mode).
• edit filesets dialog hooked up to proper notification of fileset
  changes, and simplification of 'setDetails' procs.
• fixed silly bug in filesetTabPreference code.

================================================================================

• some wwwMenu fixes
• setup assistant switch of "developerUtilities->alphaDeveloperMenu"
• some "dialogs.tcl" work.
• nice isearch/rsearch improvements from Martin.  In particular,
  ctrl-s ctrl-s now continues the last search, and we get better
  notification messages in the status bar on termination etc.
• proc: dialog::make seems to work reasonably well now.  Needs additions for
  other dialog item types.  A quick example is:
  dialog::make {First var Hey 1 flag blah 0 Folder hey ""} {Second var Hey 2}
  The goal is to make it easy to build up dialogs without worrying too
  much about their contents.
• minor auto_path changes for Alpha 8.
• proc: diskModifiedHook procedures now take 1 or 0 as extra argument
  depending on if the file is modified on disk, or has just become
  unmodified on disk (e.g. because of a 'revert').
• cvs vc improvements.
• some minor improvements to proc: remote::get (particularly for Alphatk).
• perforce vc checkin works (seems to require notion of stdin, so
  probably doesn't work with MacOS client -- anyone who uses it,
  please check).
• lots of new contributions: bibtex mode 3.5.1, metafont mode, filters
  menu, emacs.tcl, macros.help, readme referencing the Alpha Web FAQ,
  and probably more that I've missed.  Many thanks!
• proc: editFilesets dialog improved further, using new 'dialog::make' to 
  simplify things a lot, plus a few bugs fixed.
• Inst mode comments/colouring additions from Craig
• remove duplicate lines replaced by enhanced version from alpha-d
  ('uniq')
• added 'proc: hook::anythingRegistered' to hook package, upped version to 1.1
• added 'preOpeningHook' to core alpha hooks
• added ability to register particular procs to files just opening
  in any fileset. (fileset-file-opening).
• as an example added 'package: filesetTabPreference' extension.
• matchIt default range of 3000 removed.  Java/Tcl mode workarounds
  removed, since matchIt now works as advertised.
• modes with no preferences at all won't silently fail on F12.
• removed obsolete 'manipulate' fileset procedures, moved new tex fileset
  code to "latexFilesets.tcl" (and editFilesets now handles tex
  filesets).  Further rearrangement of filesets code for added
  robustness.
• some Tcl support for hierarchical help menu ("menus.tcl")

• added 'newforeach' which replicates some of the functionality of Tcl
  8's foreach command (but works in Tcl 7).
• more vcs improvements (cvs stuff partially works now).
• new diff mode from Jon, with minor updates from Vince.
• updated some app:: procs so they work correctly with application signatures 
  stored as array variables, not as globals (e.g. vcsmodeVars(cvsSig)).
• proc: app::runScript now has 3 values for 'runInBackground'.  You'll
  usually want to use the '1' value, but there is now a '2' option.
• added 'quietly clear marks' to appearance prefs page (it was lost in
  'Miscellaneous packages' land for some reason).
• some isearch improvements (thanks)
• diff mode special casing for macos/other in app::runScript
• isearch handles 'ctrl-w' to add next word (but ctrl-s ctrl-w doesn't
  work, it seems)

================================================================================

• improved bibtex mode (thanks Craig)
• enhanced proc: file::openAny to replace generalOpenDiskItem
• proc: performSearch in supersearch package no longer beeps on failure,
  unless you supply a '-beep' flag.
• minor improvements to filesets, especially to proc: editFilesets dialog
• 'vc' moved to 'vcs'.  The versionControlMenu now feeds off the vcs
  package in the core.  The perforce vc system now actually does
  something!
• added filters menu (thanks Bernard).

• better remote tcl/tk support added to Tcl mode.
• Tcl 8 fix for viewValue
• addition of 'proc: prefs::removeObsolete', used by Tcl mode now.
• made control-tab the default for 'complete' instead of command-tab. 
  This avoids conflicts with MacOS, and knowledgeable people can still
  easily return to the old version.
• we can now use core tclIndex files and formats, and hence do not need
  our own 'unknown'.  We do need to override auto_mkindex/auto_reset.
  This may be used in Alpha 8.
• Edit Mount Point added to ftp menu (thanks Donavan).
• minor search, shell improvements
• mode assistant fixes.
• 'proc: menu::insert submenu' now accepts any number of additional arguments 
  which can be various menu flags (e.g. -p proc).
• new core file "vcsCore.tcl" to handle ckid/vcs popup in Alpha 8
• split part of "filesetsMenu.tcl" out into "filesets.tcl" (CorePackages);
• minor changes to tclMode
• added proc: file::setSig to accompany proc: file::getSig in 
  "fileManipulation.tcl"
• package: recentFilesMultiMenu now integrates with filesets, provided you use 
  the 'editFilesets' dialog.  It helps to define a couple of
  'recurseIn' filesets for this.
• vcs package can be turned on to allow attaching of vcs info to
  filesets.
• note that the editFilesets dialog is still _very_ primitive, and
  needs a lot of work for editing the more complex datatypes.  Feel
  free to help!

  ctrl-i switches the case-sensitivity of the current search
  ctrl-backslash toggles interpretation of \n,\r,\t in non-regexp searches
• fix to proc: dialog::pickMenusAndFeatures (thanks Dominique).
• 'proc: refresh' does nothing if no window is open.
• beginning of separation of tclMode into 'Tcl/Tk mode' and an Alpha
  developers' menu.  The Tcl menu will only contain items relevant to 
  editing/running general Tcl files, and the Alpha developers menu
  contains everything specific to Alpha/Alphatk.  It also subsumes the
  role of the 'developer utilities' package, which is now obsolete
  (you should delete it if you have it in Tcl:Packages).
• fixed problem with proc: mode::features not being saved in preferences.
• proc: comment::Characters doesn't write a message on failure

================================================================================
= 7.4a9 released			   		last update: 04/15/2000 {14:12:44 PM}

• fixed colorsMenu (www->url) recent bug.
• added 'open' items to file menu
• worked around ftp problem with some servers and directory links,
  also made ftpList more robust when using FTP package.
• minor fixes to supersearch, proc: dialog::describe from Dominique
• couple of fixes to proc: dialog::pickMenusAndFeatures
• minor changes to vc stuff.  Needs lots of development!
• more robust proc: renameFileset
• new Setext mode (thanks!)
• "menus.tcl" addition for Alpha 8 (Jon)
• isearch/rsearch/regIsearch redone so they are all now implemented almost
  completely in Tcl, and 'backspace' works pretty much the same as
  emacs: it moves the search back to the previously found item.
• Tcl mode improved colouring

================================================================================
= 7.4a8 released			   		last update: 03/31/2000 {15:34:43 PM}
================================================================================
• beginning of support for variables inside namespaces instead of just
  inside arrays, in dialogs code -- actual use of this code will 
  probably wait until Alpha 8.
• added change-log mode (Chng) so we don't need to mark/color the
  changes files any more
• code sharing between mode/global/array prefs modification in dialogs
  code.
• Dominique's fix to proc: dialog::describe added for Alpha 7.x
• added 'case replace' feature to super search package.  Currently
  only works for single 'replace', not replace-all.  When doing
  case-insensitive matching, it tries to match the case of the
  replacement string with that of the found string.  So you can
  replace 'hello' by 'goodbye' and 'Hello' by 'Goodbye'
  simultaneously.
• Some code in "library.tcl"/rebuild to try to work around problems if
  the user has decided to rename Alpha's home while alpha is running.
• added 'open remote' to file menu
• the 'where' position of 'proc: menu::insert', which used to be either an
  integer list index, or 'end', can now also be the name of an
  existing menu item, before which the insertion should happen.
  The recentFile(Multi)Menus use this now.
• added functionality to proc: dialog::pkg_options to allow it to handle
  a given list of variables in any given storage location, rather than
  automatically grabbing all variables.

================================================================================
= 7.4a7 released			   		last update: 03/28/2000 {11:26:59 AM}
================================================================================
• some of the prefs:: procs can now take multiple arguments
• package: recentFilesMultiMenu uses a better method for declaring groups which
  allows unlimited groups. You will have to remove all your old
  settings for this package (it won't convert the old prefs over -- I 
  suggest you deactivate the package, then remove all multilist and
  recentFilesMultiMenu saved settings, then reactivate it).
• Heavy simplification of proc: dialog::pickMenusAndFeatures and associated
  helpers/callers.  The code should now work properly with the new
  Menus/Features separation.  It is also a lot more obvious how it
  works! We also only use a popup title if there's more than one page.
  Hopefully won't have to touch that code again!
• Fix to new: duplicate window names should check 'winNames' not
  'winNames -f'.  Mostly only a problem for Alphatk.
• Addition of simple mode creation assistant (Config menu for the
  moment) (in CorePackages:"modeCreationAssistant.tcl")
• Modes can now use the string 'source' instead of a dummy proc. Alpha
  checks for that string when rebuilding package indices and
  substitutes the appropriate 'source filename' statement.  In the
  future we might even want to do this automatically, and remove the
  need for any such source/dummyProc at all.
• Rebuild single directory tcl index in Tcl menu
• proc: dialog::findAnyApp added to "dialogs.tcl"
• proc: sendOpenEvent fixed for Alpha 8, when using directories.
• beginnings of an API for modes and their features.  Goal is to make 
  all calls/queries about mode existence and mode features go through 
  just 3-6 procs.  mode::features array should be hidden, and its
  structure should be opaque.
• prefs loading no longer set globals vars 'arr,field' etc with Tcl 8.
• minor "fileManipulation.tcl" fixes
• fix to help in pick menus and features dialogs for Tcl 8.
• proc: activateHook setting of 'undo' enabled status fixed.
• rebuild package indices maintains the proc: index::feature array status
  better across rebuilds, which should avoid problems if you choose
  not to quit, or if you have certain menus active during the rebuild.
• sig prefs can now be set in package prefs: i.e. they need not be
  global.
• yet another change to recentFilesMultiMenu, changing the storage
  mechanism for groups, and allowing external code to register groups
  together with a script/proc which can test if a given file is in the
  group or not.  IMPORTANT: You absolutely have to disable this
  package, remove your recentmulti settings, and then re-enable it 
  to avoid problems with clashes with old prefs (sorry, but it is beta).
• fix to prefs clashes between ::var and var on Tcl 8, and to silly
  new supersearch dialog problem for Tcl 8 when using 'prefs...'
  button.
• removed sourcing of "aemain.tcl" at startup, since no longer required
• ensure alpha::packagesAlwaysOn is added to proc: global::features

================================================================================
= 7.4a5-a6 released			   		last update: 03/22/2000 {19:43:53 PM}
================================================================================
• fix to menu initialisation for proc: menu::replaceRebuild (so Tcl menu
  doesn't appear on startup).
• Diff mode copes with filenames containing glob-sensitive characters
• Added shared lib type to installer.  By default anything that 
  ends in .shlb in the toplevel is copied to $HOME.  In the future we
  may wish to differentiate between Tcl-general extensions (e.g. TclAE)
  and Alpha-specific extensions (none currently exist), and handle
  them differently.
• removed most 'insertColorEscape' in favour of proc: text::color, and
  proc: text::hyper which work with Alphatk, and in the future will be 
  quicker with Alpha 8.
• better handling in proc: editMark for strange file names.
• really fixed so ae code isn't required at startup when rebuilding
  everything
• fixes to doc projects package.
• final "Alpha Manual" from Johan.
• updated sql mode for Alphatk compatibility, minor similar fixes to a
  bunch of other less-used modes.
• Text, PS, and Inst modes moved into their own (small) files to make
  core code a little more consistent.
• BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: The 'dummyProc' argument to 'proc: alpha::mode' is only
  ever evaluated the _first_ time the mode is used.  Since all current
  modes use empty dummy procs, this shouldn't make any difference to
  any of them.  Note that, since all we do is 
      eval $dummyProc($mode)
  we needn't use a procedure name here.  In fact any piece of Tcl code
  will work fine.  The newly-moved Text, PS, Inst modes use this
  technique.  This change makes modes behave similarly to features,
  and should allow us to simplify the code internally in the future.
• The funcs menu should work better in C/C++ modes, and should now
  work for these modes in Alpha 8 and Alphatk, which it didn't before.

================================================================================
= 7.4a4 released			   		last update: 15/3/00 {10:16:34 pm}
================================================================================
• more improvements to setup wizard
• added useDynamicMenus flag for Alpha 8
• partial implementation of 'edit filesets' functionality (if anyone wants
  to finish it off, see 'proc: fileset::edit')
• changed opt-up/down bindings to be pageUp/Down.  Now control, opt and cmd
  up/down have progressively larger magnitude
• ftp fileset dialog improved a little
• "Developers FAQ" renamed to "Alpha Developers FAQ" - please delete your
  old version if you used earlier 7.4 alpha releases.
• Some improvements to the Tcl 8 section of "Extending Alpha"
• Added support for balloon help for menus in AlphaTcl.
• Fixed help of flag-features moved to prefs dialogs.
• numerous dialogs fixes, and separation of menus and features in menus.
• it appears as if the 'help' button in some dialogs throws an error
  on occasion.  Feel free to try to fix this.  Unfortunately the 'dialog'
  command internally has fixed limits on the number of items in a dialog or
  in fact the total 'size' of the dialog, and this may be exceeded in these
  cases (an enterprising person might be able to find the correct code and
  increase the size of the handle which is allocated).
• no longer requires tclae code at startup
• improved some help texts
• changed some keypad bindings

================================================================================
= 7.4a3 released			   		last update: 13/3/00 {11:14:29 pm}
================================================================================
• improvements to setup wizard
• moved default filesets to setup assistant and fixed filesets code so 
  it works if there are no filesets in the menu.
• note: if you don't ask the assistant to create the default filesets for
  you, they will probably not exist any more, although they may be
  cached in the menu.  You should rebuild all the filesets to remove them.

================================================================================
= 7.4a2 released			   		last update: 13/3/00 {8:56:10 pm}
================================================================================
• proc: dialog::multipage now takes the dialog title as first argument (and
  for Tcl 8 this is now shown)
• fixes to help text calculation in menus and features dialogs
• re-order of Help menu
• fixes to three $..::.. Tcl 8 isms.
• entire winMenu disabled when no windows with Alpha 8
• support for 'flag' packages in standard prefs dialogs instead of menus and
  features dialogs.  This support is incomplete, in that not all the 
  functionality of the old dialog is available for these items.  For 
  instance if a flag is on globally we can't now turn it off for a mode.
• moved 'proc: iconifyOnSwitch' into a separate package.
• moved cleanup of ftptmp cache to "ftpMenu.tcl" in a quitHook
• changed F7 bindings in colorMenu to add control key
• added 'proc: ensureNamespaceExists' and made tclMode, prefsHandling use it.
• incorporated most of Jon's new AE code (including minor changes to
  "tclMode.tcl", "appleEvents.tcl", "dialogs.tcl" etc.)
• improved dimming of electric menu (thanks Dominique!)
• updated to Jon's latest AE code.

================================================================================
= 7.4a1 released			   		last update: 8/3/00 {9:46:13 pm}
================================================================================
• small fix to electricReturn initialisation (due to recent change in
  behaviour of features), when package isn't used at all.
• moved hook::register keyboard out of Calc mode init so we don't load
  "calc.tcl" on startup
• added code to "dialog.tcl" to support use of 'set...' without
  destroying dialog (works with Alphatk, and Alpha 8)
• rebuilding package indices now synchronises the active state with
  what it was prior to rebuild, so quitting _may_ no longer be necessary.
• all backup related code is now in the 'backup' package, so anyone
  wanting to modify that (to save multiple versions etc), should find
  that easier.  Unfortunate side effect is that you must now turn on
  the backup package manually ("Config->Preferences->Menus and Features",
  go to the second page, and click the checkbox by 'backup').
• moved 'execute' binding from emacs.tcl to core, removed zoom binding
  from emacs package, since a default exists already.
• fixed problem in automatic flag menu code so changed items are
  recorded as preferences to be saved (e.g. Current Project menu).
• cross-platform additions to "appleEvents.tcl"
• setupWizard added to new "setupWizard.tcl", with some trial stuff
  in there.  Volunteer(s) needed for improvement....
• added "Developers FAQ" to the help menu.
• fix to proc: dialog::text in rare case of text being just whitespace
• improvements to www code (mostly for Tcl 8)
• added balloon help for menus and features dialogs (for Tcl 8 only)
• minor fix to package index rebuilding when using internal-only
  'proc: alpha::declare' syntax.
• Added use of dialog -T flag if possible to supersearch, menus and
  features and some prefs dialogs (Tcl 8 only)

================================================================================
= 7.3 released				   		last update: 00-02-16
================================================================================

• "www.tcl" additional functionality for FTP package, and addition of
  optional replyHandler parameter to proc: ftpStore.
• fix to proc: prefs::addArray so it deletes old array entries.
• added 'command: placeText' which simply inserts text into the window
  without moving the insertion point or changing the selection.
• improvements to dynamic addition of entries to browse windows.

================================================================================
= 7.2.4 released					last update: 00-02-08
================================================================================
• fixed some problems with loading of menus.
• added a menuBuild hook to proc: menu::buildSome.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.3b2 released					last update: 01/06/2000 {09:18:47 AM}
================================================================================ 
• glob -types dir now returns directory names without the trailing ':', as
  does Tcl 8.3b1.  This simplifies some code which had special cases
  for the emulated glob, and fixes the b1 startup problem.
• updated package: isoTime (thanks Frederic)

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.3b1 released					last update: 01/05/2000 {17:34:05 PM}

• eudoraMenu now actually contains a mode.
• case-independence of overriding AlphaPrefs now properly handled.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2 released					last update: 11/12/1999 {4:04:34 pm}
================================================================================ 
• small bibtex mode fix
• 'lth' fix

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc10 released					last update: 28/11/1999 {8:29:38 pm}
================================================================================ 
• 'lth' fix
• minor tcl mode improvement (itkwish etc)
• added support for dvipdf, distill etc to latex mode (and menu) -- many
  thanks to Jan de Leeuw for this.
• ftp menu help points to the right place.
• something of a workaround for moveFile bug (and hence Anarchie problem)

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc9 released					last update: 17/11/1999 {11:30:57 pm}
================================================================================ 
• minor install improvement
• tcl mode marking improved for itcl
• proc: Tcl::MarkFile fix for itcl:: stuff
• New 'Save Preferences Now', subject to debate on alpha-d, and possible
  change in prefs saving behaviour in future.
• fix for alpha::packagesAlwaysOn
• browseFileset improvement
• "browserMode.tcl" improvements
• supersearch single-line multi-batch word-match bug fix

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc8 released					last update: 11/11/1999 {6:00:00 pm}
================================================================================ 
• made proc: package::require adjust the proc: global::features list so prefs
  dialogs are synchronised with packages turned on either by Alpha
  or by other packages.
• potential newPref/global bug fixed
• made functionComments package independent of electricMenu --- if
  electricMenu isn't activated, the function comments menu is placed in
  "Win Utils" instead.
• paragraph code moved to separate file
• odd fromHierarchy bug fixed
• html fix for iCab
• minor modeSearchPaths improvement in finding related files
• smarterSource should now warn you if its folder doesn't exist any
  more.
• moved quote:: procedures to their own file, and added better
  explanations for some.
• minor fixes for MATL mode to better work with AlphaTcl 7.2
• created 'alpha::packagesAlwaysOn' for those things the user cannot
  disable in the packages dialogs (e.g. Alpha, AlphaTcl, isoTime), and
  hence should not appear in those dialogs.
• lots of prefs manipulation procs now in 'prefs' namespace.
• minor improvement to proc: Tcl::MarkFile for namespaces.
• fixed error in Alpha Commands: addDef, addArrDef etc are NOT the
  best way to remember information between sessions.  These procs will
  read and write every single preference the user has stored (possibly
  thousands of lines of data read from and written to file), even if
  only a single item (or even nothing) has changed.  The best way is to
  add to the global vars 'modifiedVars' or 'modifiedArrayElements', or
  to use the new procs 'proc: prefs::modifiedVar', 'proc: prefs::modifiedArrayVar',
  'proc: prefs::modifiedModeVar', which will then automatically save the
  correct information when the user quits Alpha.
• default electricSemi behaviour enhanced to avoid electric behaviour
  if you're in the middle of a block comment.
• revert takes '-w <win>' optional arguments.
• minor improvement to proc: alpha::menu to allow for better autoloading 
  behaviour.
• fix for Anarchie changed behaviour (again!)

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc7 released					last update: 28/10/1999 {9:04:02 pm}
================================================================================ 
• fixed menu init problem for menus whose icons can change
• split functionComments out of docProjects

  mode (sending appleevent to textures when it wasn't running).
• fixed dialog/newPref interaction problem.
• minor proc: procs::pick fix for Tcl 8

================================================================================

================================================================================ 
• added sigs for CMacTeX
• supersearch sped up for single-line multi-batch searches (common case)
  no longer needs to scan each successful file twice.
• moved some Brws related code to that mode, and added some helpers to
  simplify common uses of the code (see e.g. supersearch), also added
  some experimental dynamic window updating code there.  Renamed a bunch
  of procs and placed old versions in "BackCompatibility.tcl".  See 
  "browserMode.tcl" for how to enable/test the dynamic stuff.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc4 released					last update: 22/10/1999 {7:54:41 pm}

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc3 released					last update: 19/10/1999 {9:21:44 am}
================================================================================ 
• internal changes to feature handling for more transparent activation/
  deactivation and greater flexibility.  Also fixes a couple of problems.
• updated a number of menu packages to use more modern alpha::menu syntax
• changeMode defines 'alpha::changingMode' internally to allow packages
  to tell the difference between on/off and mode changes.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.2fc2 released					last update: 13/10/1999 {11:41:18 pm}
================================================================================ 
• far more robust startup: can now startup even if Tcl index files are
  missing or corrupted.  New file alphaVersionInfo.tcl
• double rebuilds of packages should not happen now, even with faulty
  installation scripts.
• minor "install.tcl" improvement
• new lth
• minor appPaths improvments for Tcl 8.x

• ftp fix for latest anarchie
• works with Tcl8.1/8.2 now (dev)
• doc projects can auto-update Copyright years now
• more robust recentFilesMenu, and proc: file::getModeForFile etc
• added fantastic ISOTime package from Frederic (in CorePackages)
  (modified ISOTime package to cope with Tcl8isms and Alphatk)
• made bunch of small changes to SystemCode and CorePackages for
  easier use with Tcl 8.  Renamed hook::list to proc: hook::information,
  cache::read to proc: cache::readContents, cache::open to proc: cache::fopen,
  dialog::variable to proc: dialog::value_for_variable
• minor doc-projects fix, when changing name of a project, menu is now
  rebuilt.
• "latex.tcl" magic char fix
• better support in Tcl mode for Itcl, and various TclPro features.
• updated Alpha keywords section of Tcl mode.
• fixed nasty package:supersearch bug
• updated 'tomac' in shellMode so it works properly with Tcl8, and
  other problematic procs.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.1b10 released					last update: 7/8/1999 {4:18:53 pm}

• installer now has option to overwrite even newer files
• removed global {} variable
• proc: closeHook more robust
• proc: getVarValue fix
• package: smartPaste fix
• DocProjects fix
• Much improved help, "Readme" etc (Johan).  The new manual is so much better
  than the old one.  I recommend everyone read it!  Especially those who
  are new to Alpha and those who have used Alpha a long time, but never 
  really caught on to all the changes in Alpha 7.0, 7.1, 7.2.
• recentFiles fix from Dominique
• some support for next Textures release: set 'useNewerTexturesInterface' 
  flag to activate this support.
• regexp space fix for Tcl8
• unusual recent files bug fix (two files, same tail, but first file doesn't
  actually exist).
• proc: tcltk::evaluate fix

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.1b9 released					last update: 19/7/1999 {10:32:15 pm}
================================================================================ 
• warning when Alpha encounters an unusual core bug, usually manifested
  as a weird startup error, and the creation of a folder 'Alpha-v'.  
  Hopefully worked around it as much as is possible.  Can't be fixed till 
  Alpha8.  (If you use 'file copy' 'file rename' 'file delete' instead of
  moveFile, copyFile etc, your code will automatically avoid the bug when
  Alpha8 is released).
• minor matlab mode modernisation
• removed extra msg from supersearch
• fixed internet updates menu sometimes empty
• AElig fix in HTML mode
• removed all references to my old email/web pages from source/help files
• startup a little more robust.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.1b8 released					last update: 8/7/1999 {1:47:57 am}
================================================================================ 
• hopefully fixed emacs menu dim bug (solution: use [set win::Active], not

• fixed supersearch: variety of issues, including browse mode support for 
  multi-line finds.

================================================================================ 
• minor recentFilesMenu ordering fix.  Infinite loop under
  odd circumstances removed.
• more robust auto-indexing, and changes to better support read-only
  directories, Tcl8 etc.
• Dominique's improvements to vsp/ring::clear for better completions
  tutorials -- Thanks!
• added helper 'proc: dialog::editOneOfMany' used by Java mode, and User
  details.
• improvements to Diff mode.
• added proc: diskModifiedHook which is called when Alpha learns that an
  open window has been modified on disk.  Default behaviour is just to
  put a message in the status bar.
• improved twiddle and twiddleWords (thanks!)

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.1b4 released					last update: 14/6/99 {6:41:22 pm}
================================================================================ 
• fixes for recentFilesMenu, install and auto_mkindex, and files in 
  wrong place.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2.1b3 released					last update: 8/6/1999 {7:29:38 pm}
================================================================================ 
• recentFilesMenu improved, and copies over old prefs.
• better handling of configuration options in first line of file
  (like: (tabsize:4)).
• better error checking in auto_mkindex which warns the user of bad
  problems.
• Frontier menu update which I forgot to put in 7.2 (thanks Johan)
• latexMenu fixes from Dominique
• recentFilesMenu improvements for duplicate files, plus prefs moved
  to separate prefs dialog in packages menu.
• fix to proc: quote::Find, and addition of proc: quote::Glob, plus fix of 
  several places which used quote::Find instead of proc: quote::Regfind
• more flexible 'proc: gotoMatch' in Brws mode.  Different windows can
  register their own gotoMatch handler (e.g. Mailboxes).
• small latexMenu addition
• Java mode compilation improvements for package hierarchies
• reworked 'glob' with extra arguments etc (see "coreFixes.tcl"), so
  Alpha works with folders containing glob-sensitive characters []{}+*?\
  Mode/package authors should go through their code and correct bugs
  involving glob.  Almost any use of glob is suspect. See
  "coreFixes.tcl" for details of new glob syntax.

================================================================================

• latex theorem labels better (thans Juan)
• recentFiles menu has a flag for alphabetical vs most recent
  ordering, and a key-binding to edit the most recent file (all recent
  file preferences are in the "Config->Preferences->Files" page).
  Thanks Juan.
• ftpMenu fix (thanks Tom)
• proc: fillParagraph works on box-comments too
• fillParagraph position remembering works well for comments (box/para)
• somewhat experimental TeX code so when Alpha is asked to edit a
  temporary file, it tries to edit the correct file instead.
• fixes to Frontier code from Johan.
• cancelled save-as bug fix.
• fillParagraph position remembering code doesn't use global vars any more
• addRemoveDollars generalised and moved to "textManip.tcl", renamed to
  'proc: togglePrefix', which takes one argument: the prefix.
• internet updates fix for ftp sites.
• minor fix to proc: date::isOlder for Alpha-dev release, plus better error msgs
• hook fix
• bibtex/tex menu interaction fix
• better Alpha-dev release compatibility
• aeparse, latex theorem, smart quotes, ... fixes.

• indentation and elec expansion fixes for Alpha-dev
• user details pref saving bug-fix with multiple identities
• indentation only messes with spaces/tabs at the beginning of the line.
• aebuild fix from alpha-d list
• more progress msgs at startup
• new cmd 'proc: alpha::flag' which simplifies some feature declarations (see
  indentation.tcl for examples).
• minor fixes to appPaths, packages, textFill
• addition of unstuffSig as a helper (can set to Mindvision expander)
• some www/ftp improvements
• indentation fix (minor)

================================================================================ 
= 7.2fc10 released						last update: 16/4/1999 {9:46:01 pm}
================================================================================ 
• minor changes to a few Help files
• minor fix to "latexUtilities.tcl"
• proc: formatEntry jumps to next non-whitespace char afterwards, 
  not necessarily the next entry (bibtex mode)
• package: supersearch can be turned off again.  The on/off ability of 
  shift-cmd-F is a purely temporary thing which is ignored when you quit & 
  restart
• fat version of Gnu Diff (many thanks to Rob Managan)
• minor preference and TeX menu changes
• preferences which aren't explicitly added to a given var/flagPrefs() 
  array entry are now added to the 'Miscellaneous Packages' item in the
  "Config->Packages" menu, rather than to 'Miscellaneous' in the 
  "Config->Preferences" menu.  This is equivalent to adding them to the 
  (Packages) array entry.
• new Applevents packages and help from Jon.
• added help to emacs pref items
• indentation pays better attention to package: indentUsingSpacesOnly feature
• aebuild improvement
• tclMode, remoteTclShell improved
• "Extending Alpha" additions
• new icons: please rebuild your desktop (hold down opt-cmd when the 
  finder starts up).

================================================================================ 
= 7.2fc9 released						last update: 12/4/1999 {5:38:56 pm}
================================================================================ 
• install .tcl won't rebuild unless some file is actually installed
  (if files are too new or equal, then no rebuild happens -- please
  test this new feature).
• improved handling of -tabsize by 'new' (thanks Tom)
• file modified on disk messages added to alphaHooks.tcl
• better copyRing, smartPaste
• removed too much recursion from cMode indentation
• fixed (I think) supersearch conflict with deleteComments via addition of
  procedure 'performSearch'.  This behaves a bit like 'search' but is for use
  from Tcl code which wishes to make correct use of further procs like
  replaceAll etc.  Also fixed proc: deleteComments bug.
• package: supersearch turned into a feature so it can be activated/deactivated 
  correctly.

• coreFixes and alphaHooks fixes for file-modified stuff

================================================================================ 
= 7.2fc2 released
================================================================================ 
• fillParagraph fixes
• keeps track of when a file has changed on disk, and adjust save/revert
  flags as appropriate.  Fixed a bunch of old bugs related to duplicate 
  windows in "alphaHooks.tcl", and added 'file changed on disk.  are you 
  sure you want to save?' functionality.  Lots of changes to 
  "alphaHooks.tcl" and "coreFixes.tcl".

================================================================================ 
= 7.2fc1 released
================================================================================ 
• Minor changes to 'early' prefs and packages: things which must be set or
  initialised early in the startup sequence.  More robust technique now.
• Version of package: AlphaTcl detached from Alpha
• System installer will give option of saving installation log before quit.
• Readme displayed after changes to either Alpha or AlphaTcl (in the long
  run we may want a different readme for these two cases).
• fixed (un)commentBox bugs
• latex fileset relative paths bug fix for Alpha dev release.
• minor startup changes.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2b4 released
================================================================================ 
• various minor fixes.  Really fixed dead-key workaround.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2b3 released
================================================================================ 
• proc: sortLines improved, and takes new flag '-d' to remove duplicates
• simplified various comment/uncomment box/para procedures.
• copyRing fixes/improvements
• filling of text inside comments!  Works for some modes at least: C, C++, 
  Tcl, Java.  Not sure which others.  Fill also now respects the selection
  limits given and won't meddle with text outside those limits.
• Dominique's workaround for dead-key problem, plus other fixes
• added latex mode flag to not take over entire numeric keypad
• Ovid bib format added to package: bibConvert.
• fixed namespace {} in package: toolboxRefMenu
• added call to reset electricMenu when bindings are changed.
• improvements to electricMenu insertions, and smartPaste
• "install.tcl" and "fileManipulation.tcl" fixes for Alpha dev. release.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2b2 released
================================================================================ 
• fixed ancient bug in changeMode related to traces
• double-space and fill and shift improvements to textFill/Manip.tcl
• tabsize back to 8 in browser window, but converted tabs to spaces in 
  text prior to entry in window.

================================================================================ 
= 7.2b1 released
================================================================================ 
• added 'Recurse in folder...' fileset (appears in search dialogs)
• fixes and improvements to tclMode and remoteTclShell
• bug fix to "alphaCommands.tcl" (templates in Shel mode etc)
• latex mode handles pdf
• minor elec template improvements
• Alpha's version will stay at 7.2, with the Tcl code's version being 
  updated by smaller patch releases (basically the application hasn't
  changed for years).
• various minor improvements to java, C, toolboxRef, textManip (from Chuck)
• fixed search dialog vanishing fileset problem
• improvements to package: supersearch, and better help text
• better C++, Tcl indentation.  Other Tcl improvements
• new proc: text::indentBy used by smartPaste, shiftLeft and shiftRight
• shiftLeft/Right now use 'indentationAmount'. This means the global 
  variable/pref 'shiftChar' is no longer used.  
• singlePage renamed to defaultSize (changes to win, menus, internationalMenus)
• minor change to "install.tcl" to make it easy to update the core
• better cMode indentation (thank you!)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1.7 and 7.1.8 released
================================================================================ 
• scanning for help text improved slightly
• "Extending Alpha" additions
• supersearch improvements
• fixed variety of unfortunate problems recently introduced
• fix silly bug just introduced
• on startup if the package indices are rebuilt, so are the tcl indices.  
  This means you can now install a package (at least simple packages) by
  simply moving them into any of Alpha's standard Tcl folders, and then
  quitting and restarting Alpha.  This is NOT the recommended way of
  installing them, since it bypasses any special installation procedure
  a package may have.  Also if the file you move replaces an old one,
  Alpha will not notice and you may well get startup errors.
• additional keyboard support, and removal of appleevent at startup 
  problem.  Fix of 'new -info' bug.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1.6 released
================================================================================ 
• backup related fixes and improvements from Johan
• auto-setting of keyboard from Johan, at least for recent MacOS.  An array 
  needs filling in for keyboard names.
• even more fixes from Johan.
• additions to 'new' --- all flags that setWinInfo takes can now be used, 
  also args '-text' to set the text, or a useful new flag '-info'
  which takes the text as the next arg, and automatically sets the
  window to a read-only shell window, and scrolls to the top after
  inserting the given text.  Useful for all those 'info' windows Alpha
  uses!  Numerous examples throughout SystemCode/Modes
• more space allowed in yesno and optionmenu dialogs
• all sorts of minor fixes.
• print header problem always had page number problem fixed
• various Diff, mark related fixes (thanks Frederic)
• simplified proc: sendUrl to use icURL.  You can over-ride it using 
  smarterSource if you want some behaviour other than standard
  Internet Config linking.
• more help text in prefs defined in globals.tcl
• simplified some regsub's in SystemCode.  Learnt a new thing: regsub always
  copies the string into the given variable, even if there were no matches.
• small bug fix to "cache.tcl"
• package: betterTemplates start up fix
• better shift left/right procs in textManip (thanks Mark)
  'shiftChar' is now a global preference.  You can add a mode specific 
  override easily for any given mode.
• added new pref type 'funnyChars' which uses quote::(Un)display 
  before/after placing in prefs dialog for easier editing.  
  'shiftChar' is an example.
• minor improvements to bibtex mode, dialogs, menusAndKeys
• smartPaste simplified (no longer a need for a preference)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1.5 released
================================================================================ 
• <shift><click> on the file name in titlebar menu also does a Show In
  Finder, rather than copying the path as it used to.
• improved help in some global dialogs.  See "Extending Alpha" for how
  to write preference help so that it is useful both now (Alpha 7.1) and
  in the future (Alpha 8.0) when it will be used automatically in balloon
  help.  See "globals.tcl" for examples of how these are written.
  FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE NEW HELP TEXT FOR POORLY EXPLAINED ITEMS!
• fixed Tcl 8 problem in errors.tcl, improved efficiency of code for Tcl 8
  in numerous places all over SystemCode.
• version number is now a 'sub-version' rather than a 'pN' patch version.
• fewer things in the core clobber errorInfo, which is nicer for debugging
  (you can switch to the Tcl shell and do 'set errorInfo' and expect 
  something useful, rather than something to do with the process of 
  switching to the shell!).  The way to avoid clobbering errorInfo is to
  avoid using 'catch' unless it is really necessary.  Note that 'catch'
  is actually quite slow too, since it has to set the error state.
• "Readme" is up to date with new menus and urls, similar fixes in a few
  places in Tcl code.
• Updated HTML mode manual
• minor latex mode/filesets improvements
• improved C,C++ indentation
• supersearch fix
• proc: saveasHook improvement
• small rearrangements of coreFixes, alphaBits
• There's now both an Alpha package and an AlphaTcl package.  In the 
  future the version of 'Alpha' will change relatively infrequently, but that
  of AlphaTcl more frequently.  Alpha is the application, AlphaTcl the set 
  of files contained in the Tcl:SystemCode directory.  If you currently 
  use 'alpha::package require/exists/... Alpha' you should probably change
  that to 'AlphaTcl' in the future if you want to check for 7.1.5 or 
  whatever.
• various minor improvements to SystemCode files, recentFiles and 
  filesetsMenu, especially regarding aliases and Tcl 8.
• fixes to ftpMenu from Johan

================================================================================ 
= 7.1p4 released
================================================================================ 
• Jon and Mark Nagata added this nice feature: Title Bar clicking has been
  modified in accordance with discussion here a few weeks ago. Mark Nagata
  and I worked things around so that clicking the topmost item (file name) in
  the popup path copies the full path to the Clipboard. "Fetched" files get
  their URL copied to the Clipboard.

  Selecting lower items in the popup (folders in the path), causes the old
  behavior of opening an SFGetBox with that folder current. <shift><click> on
  a folder item opens the appropriate folder in the Finder (this was always
  there).
• no longer automatically remove leading, trailing and double 
  menu-separators automatically.  Package writers are assumed not to
  make such errors. (there was a conflict with the win-menu).
• internationalMenus fix for new menu setup
• change... changed to changeMode...
• better proc: file::showInFinder from Juan
• fix to procs::reformatEnclosing
• addition of icon resource to Alpha, and BNDL, FREFs for installer files
  their type is 'InSt'.   developerUtils package updated accordingly.  
  You'll need to rebuild your desktop to see the new icon on such files.
• minor codewarrior menu fix, and prev error addition
• prevMatch added to browser mode
• beginning of support in ftpMenu for http too (the 'fetched' and other
  variables take a fifth element the 'type' = ftp, http etc).
• added couple of mark related procs to Alpha commands.  Simplifies Diff 
  mode.  
• proc: procs::findEnclosing is now happy with procs which don't start a line.
• some documentation in "Extending Alpha" for how to embed preference help
  in your package files.  This will be used for balloon help in a future
  Alpha release.  It is currently used when you press 'help' in a dialog.
• changed version to p4 (!)
• fixed v. rare problem in alphaHooks with lsearch
• TeX fixes (thanks!)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1p3 released
================================================================================ 
• proc: dialog::text, proc: dialog::yesno are nicer, and proc: dialog::alert 
  has been added.  In particular, dialog::yesno has configurable buttons.
• better startup error messages (using new procs)
• addition of UniversalHeaders pref to C++ mode, and opt-Q key-binding
  to open one of the headers v. quickly.
• improvements to "fileManipulation.tcl" and "prompts.tcl"
• minor emacs fix
• lots of menu rearrangments after recent discussion on Alpha-D
  (feedback on new arrangement much appreciated)
• required a bunch of code changes.  In particular the docProjects package
  needed updating for the new structure.
• fixed little bug in proc: dialog::text (manifested in special keys... dialog)
• internationalMenu updates for new menus
• few more menu changes
• proc: dialog::password new proc in core Tcl
• minor improvement to C++ mode indentation

• tiny latex mode fix (missing '.')
• fix for startup after previous problematic startup (rare problem)
• fix in proc: file::getModeForFile in case of aliases
• better startup error messages
• minor changes to tclLog and shellMode
• latex mode has a 'customising' section in the manual.  Not much 
  there yet.
• improved java mode
• latest HTML etc modes from Johan.
• auto_mkindex now includes procs not at the beginning of a line (Tcl 
  8.0.3 or newer do this too)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1p1 released
================================================================================ 
• updated urls, links etc to Pete's and Vince's new web/archive sites.
• proper bibtex mode included
• bug fixes from Johan to search, clickUtils, browserMode
• Jon's new jumpPrev/Next func
• Juan's 'proc: quickSearch'
• minor TeX improvements
• AlphaBits.tcl works for 7.1 and 8.0 dev version (not publically available)
• package: autoContinueComment is now a feature so you can turn it on/off
• horiz scroll bar is on by default
• java marking and menu improvements/fixes
• various indentation/beginning of file fixes in generic code
  (could cause infinite loops in java mode, for instance)
• added package: indentUsingSpacesOnly for Rowland.  It just needs 
  activating for whichever mode requires it.
• fixed slow return in latex mode for Rowland
• replaced previous fix with new package: commentsArentSpecialWhenIndenting
  which can be used in any mode.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1 released
================================================================================ 
• updated links and urls for Pete's new sites
• register application included with distribution 
• fixed couple of bugs in electric menu and docprojects
• fixed perl electric left/right problems
• fixed C++ indent empty line
• fixed smarterSource startup problems
• various latex fixes and all other stuff reported on Alpha-D
• updated Johan's link to new docs

• "win.tcl" minor fix
• new icons added (caml + some tcl related ones)
• latex improvements
• bib to refer
• eudoraMenu updates
• shellMode fix
• BNDL bits set

================================================================================ 
= 7.1fc5 released
================================================================================ 
• new "win.tcl" (thanks Chuck)
• recent files fix
• proc: parseFuncs calling mechanism improved
• file extension mappings for each mode are stored without cr's etc.
• few documentation improvements
• removed pagestyle-empty etc from latex sectioning
• more latex documentation improvements
• electric Colon is a feature like the other electric things.  Modes 
  should remove any mode var 'electricColon'.
• sped up the global return/brace/tab type routines by avoiding calls 
  to 'unknown'.  Side effect of this required some changes elsewhere.  
  One benefit is that things should work with tcl8 unchanged now.  
  Other side-effects: <mode>::<proc> is now required for the usual
  electricX, carriageReturn etc.  The backwards compatible 
  <mode><proc> have been removed (I don't think any modes use the old 
  versions any more).  Changing mode will be slower the first time, 
  since Alpha now forces mode specific procs to be loaded.  Various
  generic procs are called '::XX' now so that everything is will work
  ok with tcl 7 or 8.  Need to think about how to make changing mode
  the first time faster.  These changes may have introduced some new
  bugs: however they'll be easy to fix.
  The trick of electric/indent procs using 'error' to force use of the
  generic procedure no longer works.  Call the generic procedure 
  directly instead (it's quicker that way too!).
• proc: text::genericIndent deprecated.  Call '::indentLine' instead.
  (backwards compatibility proc is included)
• changing mode faster again, but relies upon new behaviour for correct
  functionality: on startup each mode must ensure its 'mode::MarkFile',
  'mode::electricX' type procs are loaded in.  Currently, I believe all
  modes already do that.  However it wasn't previously a requirement;
  now it is.  The list of procs which must be loaded are stored in the
  'mode::procs' variable.  The reason I don't force the attempted 
  loading of each of these procs is that that takes a long time if the
  procs don't exist.
• document projects help file included.
• hopefully updated all links to Pete's new ftp and web sites for 
  Alpha.
• eudora menu 'global' option added

================================================================================ 
= 7.1fc4 released
================================================================================ 
• eudora menu problem fixed

• Java improvements
• Documentation improvements.
• new HTML mode and manual.
• fixed problem with proc: dialog::handleSet when used from multi-page 
  dialogs which contain sublists of items (WWW dialog problem).
• fixed help for 'get_directory' to show 'Cancel' = error, not empty string.
  Fixed couple of places in dialogs.tcl which relied on empty string 
  behaviour.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1fc2 released ('+' release was due to incorrect initial release)
================================================================================ 
• numerous fixes from Johan -- many thanks as ever.
• two replacement icons (IE,..)
• updated HTML and related modes and manual
• minor C++, Java improvements
• increased Alpha's prefered memory allocation.
• updated to Mercutio 1.5.1
• file::revert renamed to proc; file::revertThese to fix file menu conflict
• updated "Alpha Manual", "Quick Start" from Johan.
• proc: menu::buildHierarchy improved to work with glob style *.{a,b} 
  patterns.
• bug fix to 'proc: menu::flagProc' when used for mode/pkg vars (array entries)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1fc1 released
================================================================================ 
• fileset menu minor improvements/fixes
• my modified version of tkDiff works more or less now (requires 
  scriptRunner and tkdiffControl packages).  Probably only useful for 
  high-end macs, since Tk is slow on MacOS.
• some Java mode improvements
• improvements to Diff, Java, Perl and Gnuplot modes
• procUtils fix, install improvement.
• package: emacs added to list of default packages.
• proc; escapeSmartStuff fix for end of file.
• "Extending Alpha" improvements (Tom and Vince)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b10 released (probably last beta release)
================================================================================ 
• Diff mode extended so can hopefully use tkDiff as a graphical Diff 
  utility external to Alpha (provided you have Tk installed)
• twiddle fix
• bunch of fixes from Johan
• Jon's new code (ae, error etc)
• latex Accents fix.
• first-time users are asked if they want standard features activated.
• proc: dialog::yesno improvements

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b9 released
================================================================================ 
• various fixes (thanks Tom, Johan)
• TeX, Bib completion problems fixed.
• 'proc: forwardDeleteUntil' procedure bound to shift-ctrl-Backspace
  (nice feature from VI: useful for deleting to the end of the 
  sentence etc.)
• features can now be turned off for particular modes.
• can add '(tabsize:4)' to _first_ line of a file to force a 
  particular tab-size.
• new Frontier menu
• Tcl mode and TeX mode fixes
• more \n file problem fixes (not sure I understand this,...!)
• new win.tcl (thanks!)
• new showVarValue

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b8 released
================================================================================ 
• release problem fixed
• printing hopefully fixed

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b7 released
================================================================================ 
• some menus updated to use init/activate/deactivate scripts.
• scripts for menus as for features: syntax of 'alpha::menu' changed
  to allow extra arguments.  However, complete backwards compatibility
  exists for all cases in which the menu name is an icon (begins 
  with '•'), which is all current cases to the best of my knowledge.
  See extending Alpha document for new syntax (closer to 
  alpha::feature than the old one).  The new syntax is a little more
  verbose than the old one but helps in that (a) it is clearer what is
  going on, and (b) it's more flexible.  
• Shell, bibConvert, showVarValue improvements.
• file volumes works now (thanks Jon!)
• supersearch replace all in single-file/selection etc much quicker
  (does it all in one go rather than searching item by item)
• proc: completion::fromList fixed
• various other problems in TeX, Bib,... modes.  thanks for bug reports
• IBM file problem fixed.
• TeX env indentation fixed.
• Changed some 'loading' to 'Loading' so all look same at startup.
• proc: status::prompt improvement
• C++ mode indentation improved again.
• Multiple identities in Docprojects package.
• Jon's new ae code (and error.tcl etc)
• "Extending Alpha" document improved somewhat.
• Shell fix to carriage-return (thanks johan)
• Some improvements to completion code, and fix for TeX Ref completion 
  problem.  Note reference completion only works properly with the
  elecCompletions package installed.
• New Perl mode (Tom) (+ new icon)
• package: bibConvert extensions (Jon)
• Improvements to package: supersearch (esp. 'replace all' code)
• Couple new 'quote::' procedures which are useful for dialogs.
• Variety of bug fixes.
• Brown camel rsrc for Perl mode.
• codewarrior menu fix.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b6 released
================================================================================ 
• duplicate window problem fixed.
• proc: app::runScript new core procedure which is used by latex and diff 
  modes.
• new package: emacs actually included this time.
• all of HTML mode included.
• couple of fixes to latex, menus, ...
• better backwards compatibility with Alpha 7.0
• alpha::mode line can contain a desired version number for 
  menus/features.  Each item is a list {name ?on-by-default? 
  ?desired-version?}.  Feature lists are remembered and updated
  automatically for new versions of your mode.
• improved developer utilities (hopefully avoid the recent HTML mode 
  problem).
• tryElseDump replaced by proc: try which has been extended a bit.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b5 released
================================================================================ 
• new HTML, JScr modes
• better package: emacs
• proc: prompt::getAKey fix, jumping to Tcl procs via cmdDblClick fixed.
• 'proc: editMark' now returns 0 if it succeeded, 1 if it failed to find 
  the mark in the given file.
• updated Modula2 mode.
• fillRegion problem fixed (sorry), and some minor improvements and 
  fixes to TeX and TeX completions.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b4 released
================================================================================ 
• can startup with 'shift' to not load prefs (broke in previous 
  release)
• latexFilesets with non-existent files (because you deleted them) no
  longer result in an infinite loop.
• 'case ...:' statements indented correctly for C,C++ modes.
• better documentation for some new stuff in "Extending Alpha" help 
  file.
• fixed Diff problem I introduced recently.
• other stuff in b3/b4: some Shell improvements, Diff improvements (Jon)
  LaTeX fixes, some dialog bugs and improvements (Johan), better menu
  disabling (Andreas),...
• remote-tcl-shell works again (updated for Jon's aeparse pkg)

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b3 released
================================================================================ 
• fixed long-standing pref dialog problem, and related new pref dialog 
  problems: hitting any button except ok/cancel causes Alpha to forget
  changes to other variables: e.g. using Set... or Help makes Alpha
  forget the checkbox/edittext/optionmenu selections you may have
  just made.  Unfortunately not too easy to fix efficiently.
• numerous niggling bugs fixed (everything reported on Alpha-D, to
  the best of my knowledge)
• better proc: escapeSmartStuff for latex (thanks!)
• new Perl mode from Tom
• all sorts of other contributions.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b2 released
================================================================================ 
• menu init script recognised and used (on/off scripts still to come)
• Jon's new aevt code, try code, ...
• working HTML modes.

================================================================================ 
= 7.1b1 released
================================================================================ 
• new menu-bindings for mode/global prefs.
• Alpha 68k in release again.
• some package-downloads bugs
• the list of menus in the alpha::mode declaration line is now a list
  of menus and features by default associated with the mode.  For 
  instance you should now add 'electricTab' etc. to that list in place
  of the mode variable 'newPref f electricTab...' of Alpha 7.0
• package: codewarriorMenu and package: thinkMenu bugs fixed
• 'electricTab' is now a feature, not a mode-preference.  This is 
  good, because it means that turning electricTab on and off on either
  a global or mode-specific basis is handled by Alpha's core.  A mode
  now has to do nothing to support electric tabs.
• Also electricReturn, electricBraces, electricSemicolon are now 
  features.  This means the corresponding mode-preferences are now 
  _obsolete_.  They should be removed.
• Global selections are now removed from the mode-specific dialogs.
• useful new proc: tryElseDump used internally a lot now.  If, for example,
  activating a new package fails, the error is caught and, if you
  have the tcl shell open (cmd-Y), the error is dumped into the shell.
• made proc: changeMode quite a bit faster (using new package mechanism)
• big changes to whole package mechanism.  Now extensions behave more 
  like menus: you can turn them on and off either globally or on a 
  per-mode basis.  The package and alpha-downloads menus have been
  combined, and the 'Menus…' selections are now 'Menus And Features…'.
  New command: alpha::feature which basically replaces the old 
  'alpha::extension' (although that is still supported).  Also there's
  been one minor change (backwards compatible) to 'alpha::menu'.
  The one probable incompatibility is any code which modifies the
  'modeMenus' array.  This is now ignored.  The code has a different
  mechanism for attaching menus to modes (which should happen 
  automatically in all standard cases).
• reorganised clickUtils and appPaths
• proc: prompt::statusLineComplete can use 'delete' as well as left-arrow to 
  backup, although Alpha's limitations mean 'delete' isn't quite as 
  nice (Try opt-Q in Tcl or Bib mode for an example).
• put all file:: procs together in "fileManipulation.tcl"
• small improvements to "modes.tcl", "menus.tcl"
• Alpha zaps your Cache when Alpha's core version changes.
• latex mode improvements
• proc: file::getModeForFile cleverer checking for 'install' on first line.
• bibtexMode fixes (thanks)
• "install.tcl" fixes from Jonathan Guyer
• rewrote proc: text::genericIndent to avoid crashes due to searching 
  backwards for a complex regexp.  Mostly occured in Java mode.
• new proc: text::inBlockComment which will check in mode dependent
  way if you're in a '/*  */' type comment (where the actual symbols
  depend upon the mode).  If your mode doesn't use asymmetric comments
  like this then the proc always returns an error.  Use 'catch' if
  necessary.
• help dialogs work for modes too
• added 'programmer' to list of default fonts.
• more help for TeX mode and for Alpha's globals
• package: supersearch implements find/replace in selection.
• two bibtex/bibconvert bugs fixed (thanks)
• include Alpha 68k in distribution.
• bunch more fixes/improvements from Johan.
• renamed bind to Bind and menu to Menu for future compatibility
  (but left in procs so old versions still work).  Its completely
  backwards compatible provided any menu you create uses just 'menu'
  for itself and its submenus or just 'Menu' for itself and its 
  submenus.  Mixing (e.g. Menu -n Blah {item1 item2 {menu -n submenu})
  will not work.  Obviously you should just rename everything to the
  upper-case version.  These are the last two of Alpha's commands which
  conflict with Tcl/Tk (as of version Tcl 8.1 at least), which will 
  make any future transition easier.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0p4-5 released
================================================================================ 
• package: bibConvert handles another inspec format
• latex mode can work with new CMacTeX 3.0 xdvi/ghostview components 
  without any changes.
• new HTML, Frontier modes
• for some reason not all fixes were included in previous distributions
  hopefully that's fixed now.
• multi-page help dialogs
• improvements to "Extending Alpha" document.  Thanks Tom.
• more bug fixes from Johan
• proc: commentLine/proc: insertPrefix improvements (many thanks)
• rename load to evaluate for future compatibility
• removed mod2completions.tcl for the moment
• special keys dialog bug fix
• (distribution problem so quick release)

================================================================================ 
= 7.0p3 released
================================================================================ 
• improved package-index-scanning and newPref gathering
• some documentation improvements
• bunch of bug fixes (from Johan amongst others)
• better package descriptions, more robust startup, better error logging
• improved package: bibToHtml available
• proc: hook::callAll now returns the number of registered procs which 
  didn't return normally (i.e. signalled an error)
• 'better templates' package significantly faster.
• Help feature in standard preference dialogs (not completely finished yet)

================================================================================ 
= 7.0p2 28-1-98
================================================================================ 
• proc: paraStart fix (proc: fillParagraph could crash Alpha due to nasty 
  recursion)  Thanks for very detailed bug report.
• Alpha will now check what's in Modes/Menus/Packages at startup and 
  rebuild if it seems something has changed (avoids AlphaLite->Alpha 
  upgrade problem, and most problems which would arise if users 
  manually install packages).  Power-users can hold down option to
  avoid the rebuild.
• better C, C++, Tcl, TeX, Bib modes
• new 'prompts' core package.
• opt-Q is new binding for a mode-dependent quick-find (Tcl, Bib modes)
• Perl mode fixed to work properly with Alpha 7.0 (previously it was a 
  bit of a hack which had some problems!)
• proc: elec::Wrap minor improvement/fix
• minor fix and some improvements to indentation.tcl
• very nice new feature.  During the package-indexing process, Alpha
  scans comments which precede 'newPref' statements, and stores them
  in its prefhelp index.  Now when you do 'Describe Mode', Alpha 
  displays by each item what it is used for.  Of course a lot of
  modes aren't very well commented at the moment...

================================================================================ 
= 7.0p1 14-1-98
================================================================================ 
• proc: saveasHook fix
• improved filesetsMenu, recentFiles, TeX mode
• year wrap-around bug in checking alpha-downloads dates fixed
• .tcl subscript bug in alpha-downloads fixes
• better checking for auto-decompressed downloads; hopefully avoids
  double-decompression, and simplifies netscape/IE problems.
• -*- Mode: XX -*- handled. (previously just -*-XX-*-)
• "dialogs.tcl" changes to handle preference-changed procedures which
  are composed of multiple parts.
• "indentation.tcl" fixes to avoid search error in non-whitespace
  searches which hit the end of the file.
• added sort paragraphs
• significant improvements to bib, tex modes

================================================================================ 
= 7.0 released
================================================================================ 
• changes to "indentation.tcl" and "cMode.tcl" and startup picture.
• added 'proc: saveUnmodified' which saves a file but keeps the old 
  modification date.
• changes to proc: elec::Wrap to synchronise with TeX mode's wrapObject
• added 'file writable' and 'file size' checks to query web for package list.
• inserted templates indent correctly irrespective of tab size 
  (really works now!)
• procPatching uses saveUnmodified to avoid problems with updating 
  Alpha's code in the future.
• TeX smart paste works
• Mercutio 1.5 final
• latexSizes improved.
• getOpts more flexible
• improved bringToFront, revert, TeX smart paste, 
• Del key works on all keyboards again.
• added aevt code to core, plus Jon's fixes. Make sure you remove 
  'Packages:aevt.tcl' if you have it.
• moved some code to 'CorePackages', just to make things a bit more 
  modular.  It's for code which the core needs, but is sufficiently 
  separated from the messy, interlinked SystemCode stuff that it 
  makes sense to keep it separate.  (Ideally everything in systemcode
  should be organised even more and almost everything will end up in
  CorePackages).  Makes maintaining and improving things easier...

================================================================================ 
= 7.0final (?) released
================================================================================ 
• fix to "win.tcl"
• added packages prefs page (add to it using proc: alpha::addToPreferencePage)

• fixed patch-level back to ""
• version in get-info is in sync again.
• proc: setFontTabs fixed to not dirty window.
• added '.' to quote::Regfind list
• can use netscape etc for updating site listings.  It fails 
  initially, but then you are told to wait till the listing is 
  complete and then select a new menu-item.
• split fileUtils into winUtils and fileUtils.
• minor changes to "indentation.tcl"
• Mercutio MDEF 1.5b2 (contains important fixes)
• recentFiles, docProjects, newDocument improvements/fixes from Andreas, Jon.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0fc3 released
================================================================================ 
• very cool menu dimming from Andreas
• HTML carriage-return problem fixed
• TeX fill paragraph small fix
• another completion tutorial fix
• Tcl var completion better
• better menu enabling/disabling
• better TeX completions tutorial
• modula 2 mode now available
• improved replaceInFileset
• internal change so '[win::Current]' or '[win::CurrentTail]' are much more 
  efficient than '[lindex [winNames ?-f?] 0]' (or [car [winNames ?-f?]]
• better menu dimming, a few internal changes to hook.tcl
• winModes renamed to proc: win::Modes (although it shouldn't really be used
  outside of the core code), use 'new -m MODE' instead.
• Mercutio MDEF 1.3.5b1 - fixes two potentially crashing bugs.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0fc2 released
================================================================================ 
• 'save' dimmed as appropriate
• variety of internal changes for better Tcl 8 compatibility
  (I think the Tcl code will work unchanged now with either Tcl7.4 or Tcl8.0)
• better startup error reporting
• some improved documentation
• filesetsMenu minor improvements

• inserted templates indent correctly for any tabsize, by noting the 
  indentationAmount pref (both basic and V'sA templates)

• some latex/bib improvements/fixes
• internationalMenus pkg fixes (thanks Frederic)

================================================================================ 
= 7.0fc1p1 and p2 released 
================================================================================ 
• TeX improvements
• 'new' fix to bug introduced in fc1 release.
• proc: global::listAllBindings and proc: global::listGlobalBindings
• describe mode gives help text too if it is short.
• internationalMenus package available thanks to Andreas
• bunch of fixes from all sorts of people -- thanks v. much.
• proc: TeX::indentLine now operates 
• package: smarterSource will be activated much earlier at startup if you use 
  it.
• you may need to remove your preference setting for 'package::loaded'
  for things to work correctly wrt turning packages on and off -- this
  is due to some internal changes in the fc1p2 release.
• added dialog::yesno which returns 1,0 or error rather than the built in
  askyesno which you always have to use '== "yes"' with.
• package: electricMenu and shell improvements/fixes (thanks Frederic)
• latexSizes has user-specifiable bindings
• Diff mode copes with context-sensitive Diffs, and has a special 
  preference for them.  also for directory comparisons now.
• Some more international-menus/keys improvements.
• better and new electric completions in TeX mode
• added the 'alpha::package disable' subcommand.  This allows you to 
  specify a script to be evaluated when the user disables a package.
• 'blink' shows some context if the blink location is offscreen.
• proc: menu::uninsert so you can remove previously inserted items.
• better Tcl completions

================================================================================ 
= 7.0fc1 released 
================================================================================ 
• useful new proc 'app::isRunning list-of-sigs ?name? ?sig?' which 
  returns 1 if an app with one of the given sigs is running, 0 
  otherwise.  Also if you pass it the name of a variable (or two).
  They are set to (using upvar) the name of the app and the actual
  sig of the app.  This proc uses a good regexp rather than scanning
  the 'processes' list one element at a time.

Remember: if your mode/menu/extension needs a feature from a new 
release of Alpha, just add the line:

	alpha::package require Alpha 7.0b4p2
	
or something similar.  Additionally the installer can use the
optional flag '-require {Alpha 7.0fc1}' to warn the user on
installation.

• some fixes from Johan (filesets etc)
• keyboard pop-up in international prefs.
• greek keybinding fix for TeX mode
• package: betterTemplates improvement
• package: latexSizes available
• minor proc: Tcl::Markfile fix
• simple international keyboards pop-up thanks to Andreas.  If your 
  keyboard isn't there, define a new 'keyboards' array entry.  See
  international section of the manual for details.
• some purgeable resource fixes from Andreas
• completion proc uses the current mode's wordBreak definition rather
  than a default (TeX mode completions work properly again)
• carriageReturn fixes a long-standing beginning of comment-line bug.
• improved 'new' and Calc mode a little bit.
• proc: handleReply now uses a queue rather than a stack.  Also 
  'proc: currentReplyHandler' always adds to the end of the queue unless
  you give it an optional parameter '1' which says add only if there
  are no duplicates.
• alpha downloads menu improved, and finds the downloaded installer 
  more robustly.
• fixed hierarchical fileset update bug due to not storing all info
  in the cache.  On restart, new submenus wouldn't actually work 
  before, until you rebuilt the entire menu.
• Tcl-dbl-click faster now.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b4p1 released 
================================================================================ 
• a few 'switch --' bugs fixed (you should nearly always add '--' after 
  regexp, switch etc for safety ;-)
• prefs menu looks nicer
• proper "unix.tcl" included
• changed DeskTop to Desktop in some Alpha dialogs (will be in next 
  non-patch release).
• describe mode fix for modes not registered as packages (Text, PS, etc)
• disabling of the current-mode menu when there's no window.
• bindings opt-p and shift-opt-e for pi and e in Calc mode.
• Updated to mercutio mdef 1.3.4 (again in next non-patch release only)
  fixes bugs, looks better with OS 8.
• added two icons
• made a dialog resource purgeable that wasn't but should have been (777)
• renameTo moved to file menu (as a dynamic item)
• added ctrl-m binding to 'nextMatch'
• few internal changes.
• removed some obsolete stuff from "Alpha Commands"
• improved alpha downloads menu
• docProjects no longer require newDocuments

• number of useful fixes from Johan
• 'don't show log' in installer actually works now!

• fixes from Tom Fetherston
• new hook 'launch' with which you can register to be called when an 
  app with a given sig is launched: hook::register launch myproc $sig
• extension documentation improvements
• auto_reset called by rebuildTclIndices (but not by auto_mkindex since
  standard Tcl doesn't do that)
• HTML + related modes updated from Johan.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b3p1 released 
================================================================================ 
• Tcl, C++, TeX, Shel mode improvements
• Key-binding fix (one old one new)
• 'special keys…' menu item
• latex mode 'choose command' currently removed.
• -provide {pkg version pkg2 version ...} install script flag now 
  available.  This checks that there isn't a newer version already 
  installed.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b3 released 
================================================================================ 
• bunch of fixes from Johan
• package-index is auto-rebuilt if Alpha version changes and it isn't uptodate
• startup improvements (more robust)
• Tcl, C++, TeX mode improvements
• install flag -forcequit
• install flag '-rebuildquit' is ignored now.  Alpha always rebuilds and asks
  if you want to quit (unless -forcequit in which case you must quit)
• the rebuilding process takes place once your install script has completed.
• proc: menu::buildSome cleaner now
• bunch of other fixes improvements from Johan, Tom
• HTML, Frontier, Javascript modes improved.
• Diff mode improved.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b2p1 released 
================================================================================ 
• '-exact' flag supported by package require
• miscellaneous minor fixes.
• some 'unix' code now in "coreFixes.tcl", rest improved and no longer needed
  at startup
• recursiveRm gone.  Replaced by '-r' option to rm.
• diff mode no longer requires both windows to be present to synchronise
  movement.  For example you may open a .diff file and look at it.  Then
  you can open the left diff window (using a menu item).  Diffs in that
  file are subsequently highlighted.  Then you can locate the right diff
  window and continue...
• package help item can now be:
  file "name"  --- a file in the Help folder
  [script] --- a script to open/edit the help file (usually jump to a mark)
  text --- a lot of text which will be put in a window for you
• small proc: package::require fix (when errors happened)
• small mode-file matching improvement for Unix eol files.
• package: smartPaste better
• tclMode, C++ mode better
• package menu quicker --- abandoned the invisible non-help items since
  with the new 'help' package sub-command it's very easy to add help.
• wwwMode is now wwwMenu (why wasn't it always?? -- thanks tom)
• Tcl mode has surroundwithbullets again
• paste, supersearch improvements
• removed silly 'indentFollowsTab' flag, simplified a number of indentation
  routines.
• latex mode simplifications
• new proc: elec::replaceText
• C++ mode has a work-around in indent-line for an Alpha-core bug.  
  Activate the new flag in the mode-prefs to use it.
• diff mode patching with only one of two windows present.
• diff flags preference changed from global to Diff mode var.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b2 released 
================================================================================ 
• a misc dialog fix
• word completion improvement
• icons for python and supercard modes
• installer more robust to systemcode changes
• some searching fixes (but see the package: supersearch too)
• 68k resources available now.
• modes with <mode>::correctIndentation defined have smart pasting if
  you install the package: smartPaste.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b1p2 released 
================================================================================ 
• ${mode}::startPara, endPara are used by fillParagraph if they exist.
• paragraph filling in Shel mode
• added international prefs, and note in manual under International Users.
• prefs dialogs handle item grouping
• installer can remove directories
• installer dialog re-sizes better
• Tcl mode can do remote stuff
• a few contributed bug-fixes (thanks!)
• added help sub-command to alpha::package to help packages locate help files.
• recent files menu much faster building
• "appPaths.tcl" imporvements
• error log options
• cache sub-dirs work ok
• renamed some of the package index stuff --- all stored in one subdir in
  the cache now.
• cache improvements
• alpha now prefers mode procs to be called '<mode>::markFile', 
  '<mode>::electricLeft' etc.  This will make things much more efficient
  and simple when Alpha upgrades to Tcl 8.  
• better Tcl::electricLeft
• new takes optional arg '-m <mode>' to set the mode of a new window 
  directly.  It also now returns the actual name of the window created.
• alpha remembers mode menu changes again now---newly introduced bug ;-(
• replace in fileset handles regexp and case-insensitive now

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b1p1 released 
================================================================================ 
• auto-loading extensions treated differently (extension without startup code)
• a menu fix
• proc: menu::buildSome better
• a local directory '${HOME}:AlphaPrefs:' takes precedence over the one in
  the system/prefs folder if it exists.
• template insertion with no stops bug fixed
• package version checking/handling better
• TeX problems fixed
• improvements to Shell mode

================================================================================ 
= 7.0b1 released 
================================================================================ 
• various fixes to TeX mode
• ftpMenu improvements, app dialog too (thanks Johan)
• Tcl mode stuff from Tom
• help file improvements
• electric menu better
• diff mode improving...
• few other minor problems
• added key symbols for a few standard bindings to menus
• diff mode much better.
• fixed startup problems
• alpha package deals with extensions, modes and menus

================================================================================ 
= 7.0a4 released 
================================================================================ 
• package uninstall command now exists (see end of the Packages Help file)
• rename package to alpha::package to avoid problems if Alpha uses Tcl 8.0
• Menus directory is now recursively scanned.
• changed some Tcl-mode menu bindings
• other fixes from Tom, Johan.
• rewrote Alpha's mode and menu loading scheme to be more like the one for
  packages.  This is altogether better.  Since we have to rebuild indices
  when we install something new, we might as well extract the startup
  information.  Hence there are new commands 'proc: alpha::mode' and 
  'proc: alpha::menu' which behave like 'alpha::package' in that they declare
  a few required things (name, version, dummyProc, extensions etc.) and
  contain an optional startup script.  Now on startup Alpha doesn't need
  to scan the modes and menus directories.  Big time-saving!
• made package-menus a separate menu item --- they are a different kind of
  thing, since they can be turned on and off at will (unlike packages which
  usually require a restart), and the user may wish to access them more
  often.
• uninstall works ok now.
• new latex mode
• fixed some diff mode bugs.
• new combined help file "Extending Alpha"
•) keys::toBind has problems with modified bindings.  This is the problem:
	'eval bind [keys::toBind /1«X»] refresh' 
works ok, but
	'eval bind [keys::toBind /1<U«X»] refresh' 
doesn't, since 'shift-1' is in fact '!', so we need /!<U«X», but it will
work if we have 'ctrl' as well as shift (for some reason...).  I'm not 
too sure how to fix this.

Fixed keys::toBind now, but in a keyboard dependent way (I think).  I don't 
think there's any other way.  There are two variables keys::mapShiftBindFrom 
and keys::mapShiftBindTo which contain the mapping required.  Perhaps these 
should be put in an 'advanced' preferences dialog.

================================================================================ 
= 7.0a3 released 
================================================================================ 
• Reorganised SystemCode and UserCode directories.  Removed a lot of 
  obsolete code and put it in the 'Compatibility' directory, so it's 
  still there if anyone wants it.  
• Modified basic word-completion 
  procedures and added general purpose indentation, electric and 
  template code.  Some of the new code merely replicates the 
  functionality of the old, some is completely new.  All of it is very 
  easy to extend and enhance with new templates, completion 
  mechanisms,… The idea is to keep Alpha's core code simple, but allow
  people to add things on without having to mess with that core too 
  much.
• Added similarly extensible option-titlebar-click procedures.
  Pop-up menu: to look for related files, option click in a window's titlebar 
  for a list of #included files, or files in the same directory or files 
  which form part of the same TeX document (it's a mode-dependent menu).
• Added regisearch.
• Simplified the flags/vars/mode/global dialog code.  It's now easy to 
  use for your for packages which aren't modes - so you can add an extra
  panel in the global options dialog with the name of your package.  
  Also added a new option: previously if 'menuFlags($var)' was set 
  then 'var' was one of the given list of items.  Now, that is still true,
  but separately, if 'flag::options($var)' is set, then var appears to
  the options dialog as one of the given list of items, but behind the
  scenes is just an index 0,1,2, etc. into that list.
  Finally the 'mode' dialog can also be used by separate packages which
  do not keep a copy of all their variables in the global scope.
  You just do "dialog::pkg_options Pkg" where all your vars are 
  stored in 'PkgmodeVars'.
• Added 'package' commands.  A simple package should just contain a 
  single line 'alpha::extension Pkg 0.95' somewhere in its file for all
  auto-loading, activation, deactivation, ... to work correctly.  Such
  a line will cause the package to be loaded at startup.  A nicer 
  package will also provide the script:
  
	alpha::extension Pkg 0.95 script
	
  where 'script' is a script which does what is necessary to 
  initialise the package so that all other capabilities can be carried
  out through autoloading.  A simple example might be:
  
	alpha::extension Compare 1.0 {
		menu::addTo Compare winInPlace
	}
	
  which would add an item to the compare menu which when selected 
  would call the procedure 'compare::winInPlace'.  This means the
  entire file ("compare.tcl" or whatever it might be called) is only
  loaded when used.  That's obviously a bit better, so packages are
  encouraged to use this latter technique.
  
  Packages may require or test the existence of other packages.
  Just use:
  
	alpha::package require VinceAdditions 7.82
	
  or
  
	if [alpha::package exists VinceAdditions 7.82] { ... }
  
  Version numbers are now handled as in standard Tcl 8.  If a version
  number appears incompatible, an error occurs.
  
• Added hook and cache procedures.
• Bound 'opt-P' in the Tcl menu to find a procedure definition using
  command completion in the status window.
• Added hooks so packages can put items in the 'current mode' and
  'global' menus.  The latter is especially useful for packages.
• Added proc 'newPref' which should be used instead of 'newModeVar'
• Package system streamlined somewhat, version numbers work a bit
  more like Tcl.
• Removed old install menu, and install proc.  This means there is
  no way to select between latex2e and latex2.09, and no way to
  install the old electric-alias code.  Perhaps someone won't like
  that.  TeX mode can always add a modeVar to toggle between 2e and 
  2.09 if people actually use the old stuff any more.
• Alpha now starts up ok with 'packages disabled' (hold down shift)
• Added a trial key-binding dialog from HTML mode.
• Note a subtle change due to the new hooks procedures.  ChangeMode
  hooks are only called when the mode does actually change.  The old
  behaviour was odd (they would also be called on activateHook and
  some other events).  Modes (such as TeX) which relied on the old
  behaviour must be fixed ('upgraded' ;-).
• Split off all mode-completion routines into a separate directory.
  They are only loaded when necessary.
• Added a "coreFixes.tcl" file which contains workarounds for bugs
  in Alpha's hard-coded procedures.
• Major overhaul of TeX, Bib modes to incorporate a lot of 
  code: integrates with filesets better, more searching capabilites
  for bibliographies/citations.  Also fixed up those modes for
  the new Tcl scheme.
• Fixed problem with flags dialogs (thanks Tom)
• Fixed bug in activateHook
• Added dynamic menu item for 'spellcheckSelection' (use Ctrl)
• Added 'Install' menu.  Any file whose name ends in ' Install' or 
  ' INSTALL', or whose first line contains the word 'install' (any 
  case) will be opened in the new 'Inst' mode.  This mode has an
  install menu, which will allow easy installation of the package
  to which the window belongs.
• Fixed a couple of subtle bugs in the dialogs code.
• mode::init hooks are called when a mode first starts up.  You can
  add new mode vars, manipulate menus etc.  However: mode-vars are
  not yet global, and menus are not yet in the menu bar.
• Incorporated numerous fixes and improvements from Johan.
• Improved package-index-rebuilding.  Now when a 'package ifneeded'
  command is reached, the 'source' command is aborted, using a 
  'return -code return' command.  This means the rest of the file is
  not sourced.  This is both quicker and less likely to cause trouble.
• Install menu code moving along.  Open any file whose name ends in
  "Install" to have a look.
• Fixed subtle startup bug; the list of modeVars was being reset.
• Decent installation dialog now.  Reorganised code into "install.tcl",
  "package.tcl" and "procUtils.tcl".  Probably still some bugs in the
  install code.
• documentation fix: 'select' can take an optional parameter '-w win' 
  (very useful for diff mode)
• Bunch of fixes from Tom.
• Made TeX mode work properly with new scheme.  This involves replacing
  all 'insertText' with a special TeXinsertText which sends things to the
  new template scheme.  Also, since the template scheme automatically
  jumps to the first template, lots of code is simplified: one can replace
  set p [getPos] ; insertText "big insertion" ; goto $p ; nextTabStop
  by just 'TeXinsertText "big insertion"'  Menu bindings for nextTabStop
  etc aren't completely setup yet.  This may have to wait until we have
  proper user-selectable bindings.
• Install code even better now.  Can install large folers of code or 
  single files.  Add 'install' anywhere to the first line of a .tcl file
  which isn't in Alpha's hierarchy to check out the new code to install
  a file like that.
• Modernised a bunch of modes (thanks Johan)
• Added numerous fixes from Johan and Tom
• Install code can now be over-ridden with various options.
• package-index-rebuilding further improved, so 'package provide' will
  now also abort a source if required.
• Recalculate the auto_index before rebuilding it after installing
  a package.
• saveasHook now correctly uses both oldName and newName as parameters.
• Added 'auto-install' feature.
• Added couple of missing print procs.
• Modified global menu, including a flags sub-menu now.
• Added some icons and stuff to the 'newMenuIcons.rsrc' file (e.g. for voodoo)
• Improvements to installation code. New facility to open a file once on
  starting Alpha.
• Diff mode much improved.
• Beginnings of tutorial for writing new modes/packages.
• Lots of small stuff...
• Beginnings of general binding procedures; see dialogs.tcl
• Binding procs work now, at least for elec-code.  Will need some changes
  to integrate back into html mode.  See config:global:elec-bindings for
  an example.
• Further package improvements.  Various menus are now packages.  This leads
  to a minor problem: these menus can be turned on and off in two different
  ways.
• Installation scripts can now use '-remove' to remove obsolete files too.
• Fixed up TeX mode a bit more, removing obsolete code and files.
• New icons in resource; you must install them.
• Improvements to installation scripts; '-rebuildquit' and '-require' flags.
• Improved pascalMode.tcl, diffMode.tcl.
• Distribution is correct now (fixed a script problem I had)
• Improved mode tutorial
• Vars which end in 'Mode' now use a pop-up menu to select a mode when used
  in any preferences dialog.
• Improved 'twiddle' command.
• Very cool new dialog features.  Any item which ends in 'Folder' is a
  folder preference, and has a 'Set…' button which allows it to be set
  directly from the dialog box.  This allows a mode to keep all of its
  preferences in one place (no need for the user to discover 'App Paths').
  Second, you can register new flag types in addition to the basic
  'flag' and 'variable'.  Currently only the type 'binding' is setup.
  You just use 'global::newType binding' and can subsequently use
  'newPref binding ...'.  How does this work?  Well, you need two new
  procs:
  
	proc dialog::specialView_binding {value} {
		# convert 'value' to non-editable textual form for the options dialog
	}
	proc dialog::specialSet_binding {name} {
		# prompt the user for a new value for the variable 'name'
		# use global::getFlag, to get its value, and 
		# global::modified 'name' 'value' to tell the dialog that
		# it was modified (if the user cancels, this change is later
		# ignored)
	}

  New types will just need procs dialog::specialSet/View_${type} ...
  
• Improved Tcl file marking.
• Added type 'file'.
• App Paths menu is now obsolete, so it has been removed.  TeX, Perl and 
  Mail code updated to use new file/folder prefs.
• package code checks version numbers now.
• Fixed major, though very infrequent, bug in newPref
• You can now lappend 'unset' variables to modifiedVars; when Alpha quits
  such variables are removed from the user defs if they are still unset.
  (otherwise the current value is of course saved).
• More menus are dynamically put together.  Avoid the use of 'addMenuItem',
  especially to the Utils and Config menus.  You're better off using
  menu::addTo 'name' 'items' which also allows you to add dynamic items
  and sub-menus.
• Modified/cancelled special flags are set/unset properly now.
• New type 'menubinding' and 'binding'.  Menu-bindings must contain
  modifiers unless they are special keys, normal bindings need not.
• Other minor changes
• Added listvar, array and Sig types
• Forced to split global flags into two sub-blocks, since Alpha chokes on
  calls to 'dialog' which are too long.
• dialog::pkg_options can now be used to edit the contents of any array:
    dialog::pkg_options "" "Title of dialog box" 1 'array-name'
  changes are recorded and will be remembered on startup.
  (you can skip items by setting 'set ${array-name}Invisible(item) 1')
• fixes couple of recently introduced bugs
• added 'SearchPath' type: a list of folders
• made it easy to create and manipulate flag-menus and option-menus from
  pre-existing mode/pkg prefs.  (e.g. two of the filesets menu utilities
  submenus use the new code)
• menu::addTo is more robust
• reorganised global flags menu
• can select prefix-chars in the key-binding dialog (emacs-ish ctrl-x ctrl-s)
• can select 'escape' as a prefix char too
• fixed stupid bug in dialog
• added 'quick find regexp' to search menu
• made the printer menu an optional package
• a few fixes from Johan, Tom and me.
• synchronise global menus and packages.
• version comparison works with alpha/beta/devel/final-candidate
• some new icons, dialog improvements, binding procedures
• new 'proc: prefs::addPackage' which will add an item '${pkg} Prefs…' to the
  global menu, and handle manipulation of a dialog for all '${pkg}modeVars'
• installer creates a log window if desired.
• installer handles 'ignore' files/dirs better now.
• How to deal with mode-vars which over-ride globals?  There are a number of 
  problems here: first it _is_ useful to have a global preference, but then 
  have, in one mode, that global over-ridden.  That happens automatically 
  right now.  The problems arise when you switch to another mode: not only 
  is the global var _not_ set to its old value, but the global var is in 
  fact unset.  Any ideas on how to resolve this?  (Tcl 8 and namespaces 
  would make this easy, I think).  I've put a solution to this in
  'changeMode' now.  It maintains a list of those globals which are over-
  ridden by the current mode, and resets their values when that mode
  switches out of scope.  It's actually not that complex or time-consuming
  a processs which is good (changeMode already does too much!).  I still
  anticipate a better solution if Alpha upgrades to Tcl 8.
• new install feature.  Previously if the first line of the 
  'OPEN-TO-INSTALL' (or generally *INSTALL) file contained 'auto-install',
  it would open iconified and the *install.tcl script sourced immediately.
  This is still true, but further if the first line of the *INSTALL file
  contains auto-install-script, then the *INSTALL file itself will be
  sourced (make sure that first line starts with a '#' or there'll be an
  error).  This removes the need for silly one-line files with 'auto-install'
  at the top.
• Number of small bug-fixes and improvements.
• Tcl proc/var completion improved. (context sensitive)
• codewarrior menu improving...
• java, C++ mode improvements, Java completions
• gnuplot mode updated even more.  Added 'editPrefs' hook.
• added file creator->mode mappings e.g. 'set modeCreator(GPLT) GPLT'
• added tclIndex files to distribution for first time users
• dialogs support arrow keys for bindings/menu items.  Seems as if menu items
  don't quite work in menus (I guess they aren't 'special' keys)
• better use-package menu (but works around a stack of nasty menu-bugs)
• bug fixes to few dialogs.
• colour dialog items grouped at end for modes.
• renamed 'modifiedModeVars' to 'modifiedArrayElements'; it was being used
  in so many places where 'Mode' was not relevant that the new name is more
  clear.  You can still use the old name, but the newer one is better.
• global/mode over-riding of variables completely transparent now.  One key
  feature is the changing a mode-specific value must happen in the mode-prefs
  dialog, and changing a global value must happen in the global-prefs dialog.
  If you do change a global value while it is over-ridden, the global value
  does change, the mode-value does not (and remains in force), and the user
  is warned that they adjusted a hidden variable, not the mode one.  Again,
  I'm sure this variable-scope-mess would be much alleviated with namespaces.
• the above change meant the removal of 'generalElectricTab' and 
  'modeSpecificElectricTab', to be replaced by a single global flag 
  'electricTab', which is over-ridden by mode-specific flags of the same 
  name.  This global flag is off by default.
• fixed minor colour problem in dialogs
• url downloading will work if you set your downloadFolder correctly
• cleaned up some temporary code.
• diffMode fixes, install fixes, dialog fixes
• url/www/ftp improvements
• You can hopefully use Alpha to download files from my web site now,
  although there are probably still bugs in the code.
• WARNING: completely new, incompatible replyHandler registration.
• What to do about 'handleReply'?  it handles apple-event replies in some 
  sort of queued fashion, and is used variously by the ftpMenu code, 
  voodooMenu, and there is also a default in appleevents.tcl Presumably 
  there should be one 'handleReply' which somehow knows who sent the 
  original event and passes the reply on to a given handler.  I've
  sorted this now.  There is one handleReply with which any other
  handler may be registered using 'currentReplyHandler procname'.
  That proc takes one argument, the reply which is to be handled
  (maybe).  If it does handle that reply it should return '1', else
  anything it likes.  You should call 'currentReplyHandler' just
  before every apple-event call which has a queued reply.
• Used a different mechanism for rebuild package indices so I don't have
  to alter smarterSource in any way.  I now use 'return -code 11' to
  abort source statements.
• Turned 'smarterSource' into a package rather than part of the core.
• Rewrote some of the menu-building code.  Use 'menu::insert' to add
  items to pre-existing menus.  It's more tk-like now.
• recentFiles menu is now a package.
• fixed nasty dialog bug in multi-page ones (hadn't reset some vars)
• made dialog code more robust to index vars badly set.
• fixes from Tom, Johan (in particular ftp code is much improved)
• even better regIsearch (very useful proc Tom's been improving)
• really made dialog code robust to index vars.
• get files from web/update list of packages should all work ok now
• numerous small fixes
• fixed up unknown procedure to be more robust (nabbed from Tcl8)
• '!!' works in the shell window now.
• better synchronisation of package activation with the menu
• better tcl mark file
• appPaths.tcl reorganised
• got code ready for 7.0 release (renamed NewMenus/Modes/System etc.)
• renamed 'package' to 'alpha::package'.  This is to make it less hassle
  if Alpha upgrades to Tcl 8.0.
• fixed menu dialog bug, install files bug, rebuild indices bug.
