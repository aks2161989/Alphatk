Please note that a large part of Alpha's functionality is implemented in
the 'AlphaTcl' core libraries.  For changes to that code, please see
the help file "Changes - AlphaTcl".

Many known bugs are listed in the "Known Bugs" help file.  If you'd like to
suggest new features etc for Alpha 8.0, please send a note to the
"AlphaTcl-Users" or the "AlphaTcl-Developers" mailing lists.

¥ updated SearchCore to the latest revision from Tk HEAD (rev. 1.55). It
  contains fixes for bug 1574.
¥ added "--" switch to signal the end of options in [getfile]. This is an RFE
  which was part of Bug 1632.
¥ removed the wrapLow, wrapHigh, wrapBreak, wrapBreakPreface, and funcExpr
  variables from the core. They are not linkvar's anymore.
¥ the sequence of actions when killing a window has been reorganized to
  streamline the order in which the hooks are executed (taking into account
  the fact that killWindow does not necessarily apply to the front window).
  When a window is killed:
	- preCloseHook is executed
	- deactivateHook is executed
	- the window is disposed of in the Window Manager which implies that,
	  at this point, it is not listed anymore by [winNames]
	- closeHook is executed
	- its internal struct in Alpha is deallocated
	- then, if the killed window was at front, activateHook is executed on
	  the underlying window (which is now the top window
  This should mirror what is taking place in Alphatk as well.

  partially solved.  AlphaX now passes hook tests 3.1 and 3.2 successfully.
  (No crash anymore when calling killWindow from preCloseHook or closeHook.)
¥ Bug 1522 ("problem with Dbl-clicking juxtaposed words") had been fixed in
  8.0b17d1 but the fix got lost in 8.0b17d4.  It has been reintroduced here.
¥ A small icon of the Unicode logo has been added in the resource fork
  (ics#/ics4/ics8 ID 309).
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ 8.0b17d6 (April 2005) was released with an embedded Tcl interpreter, 
  following discussion on the developers list inspired by bug# 1830.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ 8.0b17d7 (April 2005) was released with AlphaTcl embedded.  This scheme
  will not be used for the 8.0 final release, but possibly for 8.1.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ 8.0b17 released 06 May 2005, compiled by Daniel.  This is the final- 
  release candidate for AlphaX 8.0.
¥ Three different disk images were created, for Jaguar, Panther, and Tiger.
¥ The Jaguar AlphaX has Tcl 8.4.6.1 embedded (built on Jaguar), but has the
  extension binaries from 8.4.9.1 (built on Panther).
¥ This needs to be tested by users on Jaguar, all the extensions appear to
  load fine, but none any of their functionality have been tested.  If there
  are issues with these, we'll have to take the extension binaries from the
  Jaguar 8.4.6.1 BI instead.
¥ The Panther AlphaX has Tcl 8.4.9.1 embedded and the extensions from the
  8.4.9.1 BI
  ¥ The Tiger AlphaX is linked against the Tiger 
  /System/Library/Framework/Tcl.framework (8.4.7) and only has extensions
  Tcladdressbook and Tclresource (the latter because Tiger contains the
  slightly buggy resource 1.1)
¥ Added missing cAlphaControlList.h, fixes for Panther deployment build
¥ Fixed all the Jaguar build issues in Jon's code by #ifdef or implementing
  an alternative; and added a number of fixes to allow building with gcc 4 on
  Tiger, and a new Xcode2 project.
¥ Implemented the strategy for $HOME lookup discussed previously (first
  look for AlphaX.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/AlphaTcl, then
  AlphaX.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/Alpha, then fallback to current
  strategy of taking the parent of the app bundle)
¥ AlphaTcl has not been embedded in the app bundle currently, but this
  change will allow people to experiment with AlphaTcl embedding with the
  final 8.0 binary (and it costs us nothing to have this already in 8.0)
¥ Synced up the extensions in Info.plist with Alpha's $filepats, and
  removed the problematic .1 .3 and .n extensions.

================================================================================
¥ Fourth public beta release of AlphaX; known issues:
 - balloon help not implemented.
 - Aqua application menu preference item inactive.
¥ This beta release will expire 270 days after its build date (as displayed
  in the startup splash dialog and the finder info version field).
¥ AlphaTcl 8.0b7 or later is required.

= Alpha8/X 8.0b15                         last update: 08/31/2004 {12:20:40 PM}
================================================================================
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D4 (February 2004) :
  ID 	Sev Summary
   429  enh Alpha8/X should call [preCloseHook] before killing window
   608  nor screen drawing unreliable
  1276  cri [zapInvisibles] in read-only mode causes an infinite loop
  1094  nor Win menu items persist for deleted files
  1255  nor Closing a window whose file has been deleted
  1313  nor [removeColorEscapes] requires colors to be added
  1270  nor Initial text is always black in empty first line of new window
  1301  nor [getTextDimensions] returns garbage
¥ the [launch] command now returns the PSN (Process serial number) as a 
  16-hex-digits number.
¥ The latest version (2.0b15) of the tclAE extension allows this PSN to
  be used in the tclAE::send command.
¥ the [processes] command now returns more info as a list of sublists. 
  Each sublist contains six items:
  (0) name
  (1) creator 
  (2) type
  (3) LaunchDate 
  (4) ProcessSerialNumber
  (5) fullpath of the executable (if the application is bundled, it is the
      executable itself, inside the bundle)
  The previous third and fourth items of the sublists (ProcessSize, ActiveTime)
  have been removed. Note also that the sublists are true Tcl lists (rather
  than artificially built flattened lists with items enclosed in double quotes).
¥ Drag and Drop implementation has been modified and now calls the [dndWinHook].
  This allows for all kinds of customizations, mode specific behaviors etc.
  (See "alphaHooks.tcl").
¥ [removeColorEscapes] and [insertColorEscape] commands have been modified so
  that they accept the ?-w <window>? flag. (RFE 1313)
¥ The [search] command uses the latest version of the searchCore() function
  from the Tk Text widget. This should fix rare cases of missed matches due
  to overlapping.
¥ Removal of Think support: the "Save As" dialog now has two radio-buttons
  replace the previous three (None, MPW, Think). They are named "Text Only"
  and "Remember Window State". The Window state popup now has a single item
  "Remember Window State" replacing the none/think/mpw trio.
¥ [preCloseHook] called before window is destroyed. (RFE 429)

  1318  nor [regModeKeywords] not case-insensitive to accented letters
¥ Cross-pane Drag&Drop fixed (was broken in the recent [dndHook] scheme)
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D6 (March 2004) :
  ID 	Sev Summary
   754  nor replaceText cursor preservation is confused by the pin
   884  nor binding problems with ¿ and dead keys
   889  nor The binding of LaTeX accents doesn't work

  1146  nor inconsistent name of CRLF
  1163  nor balance and <>
  1261  nor [search] finds \r after [maxPos]
  1348  blo Dead-key combinations or other high-bit letters crash AlphaX 8.0b15_D5.
  1358  blo Set Window Geometry dialog calls itself again, crashes.
¥ text wrapping is now handled via [characterInsertedHook].
¥ a "paneNum" key has been added to the array returned by [getWinInfo]. It tells
  which is the active pane of a divided window (0 for top, 1 for bottom).
¥ removed the support for <> pairs from [balance]. (bug 1163) OTOH, double-clicking
  on one of the symbols of a <> pair still selects the enclosed region and the
  [matchIt] command still supports the <> pair.
¥ concerning bug 1358, only the crash issue has been solved. The reentrancy
  problems still have to be addressed.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D7 (April 2004) :
  ID 	Sev Summary
  1361  nor [listpick] doesn't like "-" to be first item in list of options
  1362  nor [listpick] does sloppy "-L <list>" parsing
   552  nor 'saveAs -f $f' still requires 'close [open ...]' in Alpha8
¥ this new development release introduces fundamental modifications. 
  You MUST update your AlphaTcl library from the CVS to use it.
¥ new core commands: [displayWrap <wrapMode>] [displayPlatform <platformName>]
  Use them to set respectively the Wrap popup and the Window State popup
  _titles_ in the status bar.  These commands only have a visual effect on
  the title of the popup, they do not mess with internal values, nor do
  they set the type of eols etc.
¥ fixed problems relative to the [fileMovedHook] hook. If a file with a window
  opened in Alpha is renamed from the Finder, Alpha will update the related
  data next time the window is activated. (A very rare case with multiple
  copies and an already existing window with the _new_ name still has to
  be addressed.)
¥ the text metrics problems encountered with the -font option in 8.0b15-D6
  [getTextDimensions] should have been fixed by Jon's recent modifications.
¥ the 4-chars limitation for the modes has been relaxed. A mode's name can
  now have up to 20 letters. Several parts of the core had to be updated (the
  [bind] and [ascii] commands for instance, as well as anything dealing with
  mode's names): please report any problem you notice.
¥ (Bug/RFE 1334) A major step towards the implementation of minor modes has 
  been accomplished with the implementation of bindtags, colortags and 
  wordbreak window properties. These properties can be set using the 
  [setWinInfo] command. Their value is a Tcl list in the case of bindtags and
  colortags, a simple regexp in the case of wordbreak. For instance:
	setWinInfo -w $someWindow bindtags [list TeX Mf Mp]
	setWinInfo -w $someWindow colortags [list Tcl TclShell]
	setWinInfo -w $someWindow wordbreak {\d+}
  One can retrieve the current value using the [getWinInfo] command:
	getWinInfo -w $someWindow arr
	set theListOfBindTags $arr(bindtags)
  Bindtags are lists of modes among which to search an appropriate binding.
  Colortags are defined using the new [colorTagKeywords] command (see
  below).  The first element in the colortags list must be a mode whose
  coloring functionality has been defined with [regModeKeywords]; the
  following items are colortags defined with colorTagKeywords. Please read 
  the new sections about minor modes in "Extending Alpha". You have to update
  to the most recent version of AlphaTcl from the cvs repository.
¥ there is a new core command called [colorTagKeywords] to define colortags.
  It is analogous to regModeKeywords but with less options since it can only
  be used to define colored keywords. Its syntax is
	colorTagKeywords [options] <colortag> <keyword list>
	Set keywords to color for the given tag. Valid options are:
	  -a         Keywords will be *added* to existing colortag
	             keywords.  The new keywords can be a different
	             color than older keywords.
	  -k <color> Keyword color.
	  -C         Keywords are case sensitive.
  For instance, one can write:
	colorTagKeywords -k red TclShell [list bar foo franny zooey]
¥ the "autoSave" and "changesLim" linked variables are not used anymore by
  the core. They will be removed as soon as AlphaTcl stops declaring them as
  linkvars.  This is also true for "fillColumn" and "leftFillColumn".
¥ word wrapping is now handled by AlphaTcl: [wrapText] is not a core command
  anymore but a proc (defined in "textFill.tcl").
¥ two new icon resources added on Craig's request (ics4 #520 and 521).
¥ the Open File dialog now lets you look inside packages (you must also
  choose "All Documents").
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D8 (April 2004) :
  ID 	Sev Summary
  1365  nor [listpick] doesn't recognize abbreviated keystrokes
¥ fix for the  "invalid tab or resource information" message reported on the
  Alpha-Developers list which can cause crashes. I hope this is solved now.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D10 (April 2004) :
   608  nor  screen drawing unreliable
  1155  enh  zapInvisibles should be zapNonPrintables
  1391  nor  Window tags not set correctly and are partially ignored
¥ also refixed a bug when wrong region was hilited after a drag and drop across
  panes in a divided window with the option key being pressed.
¥ two new global variables have been added to customize the behaviour of the   
  Open File dialogs:
  * the showInvisibleFiles variable indicates whether invisible files
    should be displayed in Open File dialogs.
  * the openPackages variable indicates whether the contents of packages
    (like bundled applications for instance) should be accessible in Open File
    dialogs. If the variable is set to 0, packages are displayed as ordinary
    files; if it is set to 1, they are displayed as folders.
  Until they are incorporated in AlphaTcl (as global preferences ?), you can
  try these new features like this:
  * first declare the variables as linked variables
	linkVar showInvisibleFiles
	linkVar openPackages
  * then set their value to 0 or 1
	set showInvisibleFiles 1
	set openPackages 1
¥ preliminary support for AlphaX Carbon printing ; requires AlphaTcl changes.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D11 (May 2004) :
  ID 	Sev  Summary
  1175  nor  Undocumented  Alpha8/X core commands (see below)
  1368  nor  Faulty behavior of dead-keys in AlphaX.
  1407  nor  typing backslashes aborts macro recording
¥ As requested in Bug 1175, the following core commands have been removed
	alloced                   isearch    
	fileMenu                  restoreVars
	getPathName               rsearch    
	init                      saveVars   
	insertPathName            winFuncTitle
¥ Modified the [getfile] command which now has two additional options:
  -showInvisibleFiles and -openPackages
  The syntax is:
	getfile ?-types <typeslist>? ?-openPackages <num>? \
	  ?-showInvisibleFiles <num>?  [<prompt>] [<path>] 
  These options let you override the default values of the corresponding
  "showInvisibleFiles" and "openPackages" global preferences introduced in
  D9.  Note that you must choose "All Documents" in the Format popup of the
  Nav dialog.  <num> is 0 or 1.
¥ The core Alpha command [get_directory] takes the -openPackages and the
  -showInvisibleFiles options just like the [getfile] command above.
  Furthermore, the default location argument now works in Alpha8/X. The
  syntax is:
	get_directory ?-p <prompt>? ?-openPackages <num>? \
	  ?-showInvisibleFiles <num>? [<default>]
¥ The "openPackages" global preference is taken into account by [SaveAs] and
  [get_directory] too (not only by [getFile])
¥ Fixed the problem of dead-key followed by non combining character:
  "circumflex + m" gave only ^ instead of yielding "^m" directly and you
  had to type the "m" again.
¥ Added new command [windowVisibility]
	windowVisibility [-w <win>] ?<hidden|normal|minimized>?
  to get or set the visibility state of a window: it is one of hidden,
  normal, or minimized.  If the last argument is not specified, the command
  returns the current state.  This is experimental: to test this make sure
  you have the most recent version of the [registerWindowWithAlphaTcl]
  proc.  You can now create a window but not display it: this could be used
  to execute some marking and coloring before displaying the window.  You
  can hide an already existing window.
¥ The [winNames] command has been reverted to its original behaviour: it
  lists windows in the stacking order.  Since now some windows can be
  hidden, it is important to note that [winNames] returns the list of _ALL_
  the windows (visible or not).  One must be aware that many parts of the
  code use [winNames]: the new behaviour might affect some of them.  On the
  other hand, a "win::Active" variable has been available in AlphaTcl which
  keeps the list of active windows.
¥ Added a property called "hidden" to the Get/SetFileInfo commands to get
  or set the visibility property of a file or a folder. For instance:
	ÇÈ getFileInfo [file join $HOME .DS_Store] att
	ÇÈ set att(hidden)
	1
  To make a file invisible:
	ÇÈ setFileInfo $somefile hidden 1
  (Note that due to a bug of the Finder itself, you don't see the effect of
  the change until the next login or restart.  Tcl will also have this
  property available via [file attributes] but this will be in 8.5 and the
  Finder bug holds there too).
¥ Added a property called "bundle" to [getFileInfo] to tell if the item is
  a bundle (doc, app or bundle package). Only for AlphaX.
¥ Other modifications in the [getFileInfo] command include:
  * previously it reported an inaccurate information for the creator and
    type of a bundled application: some parts of xserv relied on this info,
    which means that they were broken.  It now does the right thing when
    called on a bundled application.  Only for AlphaX.
  * in the case of a folder, [getFileInfo] will not report "datalen",
    "resourcelen", "creator" and "type" keys since they do not make sense for
    a directory (the info previously reported was garbage).
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Bugs fixed in 8.0b15-D13 (August 2004) :
  ID 	Sev  Summary
   552  nor  'saveAs -f $f' still requires 'close [open ...]'
  1239  nor  [search] becomes non-greedy after \n in pattern
  1373  nor  [getTextDimensions] in Alpha8 throws error with new dialogs code
  1454  enh  RFE: -indices flag to [listpick]
¥ RFE 1454 ("-indices flag to [listpick]") is implemented. If the -indices
  option is used, the index of the selected item is returned rather than the
  item itself (or a list of indices if several items have been selected using
  the -l option). For example:
	ÇÈ listpick -indices [list orange lemon grapefruit]
	2
	ÇÈ listpick -indices -l [list orange lemon grapefruit]
	0 2
  In the first case "orange" was selected; in the second, "orange" and
  "grapefruit".
¥ Fixed a bug in saveAs when the file does not already exist and
  its name contains spaces. This should definitely close bug 552 I hope.
¥ A new property called "flags" has been added to the get/setFileInfo
  commands to get or set the Finder's flags for an item.
¥ Finally I thought I had fixed the problem of cursor beam being written at
  start of line when the Return key is pressed (reported by Joachim in the
  message "cursor leaves trace at <return>" on AlphaDev list). The code
  dealing with this was dependent on soft wrapping had been removed
  (disabled). I restored it but unfortunately I still see the beam from
  time to time. Not a major issue anyway.
¥ the [getColors] command accepts the -w option
¥ the [icon] command accepts the -w option. This was documented in "Alpha
  Commands" but in fact not implemented.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ A few more bugs at least partially addressed in 8.0b15-D14 (August 2004) :
¥ Bug 1453 - Regexp problems not handled properly by [search]
  Now the result will be more informative in case of a malformed regexp. For
  instance:
	ÇÈ search -r 1 A++ 0
	Error: couldn't compile regular expression pattern: quantifier operand invalid
  Concerning the -n flag, it now works as advertized, i-e it won't throw an
  error whatever happens and the result will be an empty string if no match
  was found.  This is the second of the two interpretations suggested by
  Joachim for this flag.
¥ Bug 1473 - Crash with shell windows (and resources)
  This bug hopefully has been fixed.
¥ The AlphaX binary embeds Tcl 8.4.7 and not 8.4.4.
¥ Note that Bug 1463 ("can't go from batchbrowser win to same file twice")
  has been dealt with in AlphaTcl (in the file browserMode.tcl).  Please
  update from CVS HEAD. The issue revealed in [editDocument] has not been
  addressed yet: I'd like to have a very precise specification of what is
  expected from the -c option in [edit -c].
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Minor changes in 8.0b15-D15 (September 2004) :
¥ Modified the definition of [nameFromAppl] which failed in AlphaX on
  Classic-only applications.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
¥ Fix for bug 1478: "Crash with [killWindow]"
¥ Fix for Bug 1463 ("can't go from batchbrowser win to same file twice").
  The [editDocument] proc should not be confused by duplicate windows anymore 
  when used with the -c option.

¥ This beta release will expire 90 days after its build date (as displayed

¥ AlphaTcl 8.0d2 or later is required.
¥ various leak fixes & performance improvements.
¥ use Nav Services AskSaveChanges dialog instead of our own.
¥ AlphaX: window iconification collapses to dock.
¥ AlphaX: implemented small menu font & tear-off menus, choose topmost item
  to tear off a menu.
¥ enabled use of more than 255 hierarchical menus on Carbon. (bug 683)
  Unfortunately this can't be fixed on classic, as the mercutio MDEF is
  incompatible with hierarchical menu IDs > 256; on Mac OS 8.5 or higher,
  we could use appearance mgr menus instead of mercutio, but would loose
  dynamic menus and tear-offs, so this isn't enabled for now.
¥ hook processing in [new] & [openFile] revised to be like in Alphatk:
  call "filePreOpeningHook", "winCreatedHook" and "registerWindowWithAlphaTcl"
  instead of "openHook".

  arguments like in Alphatk.

================================================================================
¥ This beta release will expire 90 days after its build date (displayed in
  the startup splash dialog and the finder info version field).
¥ Mac OS 8.5 is no longer required.
¥ Navigation Services are used throughout if the UseNavServices preference
  is set (on by default).
¥ Changes to the dialog filter: multi-line edit fields now use <opt><return>
  to enter a literal carriage return; both <enter> and <return> again click
  the dialog's default button.
¥ Split up AlphaTcl startup process like in AlphaTk: first source
  initAlphaTcl.tcl then bring up GUI (i.e. status bar), and finally source
  AlphaBits.tcl. This allows for early pref reading before the GUI is brought
  up, in particular a new pref for status bar position: locationOfStatusBar.
¥ Status bar snaps to bottom or top of screen when moved close, and sets
  the locationOfStatusBar pref.
¥ Windows are constrained to (screen area minus status bar area) on
  zoom & resize, changing locationOfStatusBar will try to maintain those
  constraints on all windows as closely as possible.
  Window dragging is constrained vertically to prevent window titlebars
  from being moved under the status bar.
  The tile* window position vars are now linkvars; tile* and def* window pos
  vars are constrained to screen in the same way as window resize/move.
¥ Tear off popup menus from windows and status bar are updated dynamically
  when their corresponding controls are clicked.
¥ Added -C option to regModeKeywords for case sensitive keyword coloring.
¥ Changed kill_window to save all resources, not just MPSR.
¥ The Tcl shared library is now weak linked and potentially imported late
  to workaround the Mac OS 9 bug causing aliased shared libraries in the
  CFM search path not to be found (Classic MacOS PPC only).

¥ Mac OS 8.5 or greater is required for this release. No, that's not a 
  permanant condition.
¥ More sophisticated dialog filter. Edit fields in dialogs support:
  - multi-line edit fields now accept literal carriage returns (use <enter>
    to click the default button).
  - <option><tab> inserts literal tab character instead of advancing focus.
  - <opt><left|right-arrow> moves to word boundary.
  - <cmd><left|right-arrow>, <home>, and <end> moves to end of text.
  - <shift><arrow> extends selection (<up> and <down> are a bit kludgy).
  - Popup menus now cycled with <cmd><up|down-arrow>; 
    this allows <up|down-arrow> to work in edit fields.
¥ Complete rewrite of the Status Bar. Appearance compliant and less modal.
¥ All popup menus from windows and Status Bar can be torn off.
