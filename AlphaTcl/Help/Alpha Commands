In this list of routines, text between '<' and '>' is a placeholder for a
required parameter, text between '[' and ']' is a placeholder for an
optional parameter, and the '|' signifies a choice of two or more
alternatives.  A '+' signifies that the previous symbol can be present one
or more times, while a '*" means zero or more times.  Some commands have no
parameters.

Where '-w <win>' is given as an optional window name, <win> can be any item
from the lists given by '[winNames -f]', '[winNames]', '[win::CreationOrder]', 
'[win::StackOrder]', or it can be the current window '[win::Current]' (in
fact that is the default).  To translate from a file path to possible
window names, use the command [file::hasOpenWindows $path].  Window names
are case-sensitive.  A window name may contain a trailing ' <n>' indicator
to show it is a duplicate, and this cannot be omitted when referring to the
window.

The following are Alpha-specific tcl routines, defined in the core of the
binary.  (In addition, of course, all the standard "Tcl 8.4 Commands" are
available.)  In Alpha8/X, most of these commands are implemented in C,
while in Alphatk they are implemented entirely in Tcl/Tk (which are
themselves implemented in C, and have seen some Alphatk-specific
improvements).

In some cases these 'core' commands are now defined in AlphaTcl or Tcl, see
the referenced source files for commands coloured magenta, or try to
Command-Double-Click on their names for more information.

= Basic insertion position queries

In Alpha8/X, some of the commands in the 'pos' namespace are actually defined
in the file "coreFixes.tcl" using global namespace building block commands.

• getPos [-w <win>] - return the current insertion point
• pos::lineStart [-w <win>] <pos> - return the position of the start of the 
    line 'pos' is on.
• matchIt [-w <win>] <brace char> <pos> [<num>] - Return pos of matching brace. 
    Recognizes parenthesis, square brackets, and curly braces.  Optional
    third argument specifies how many characters to search.  The brace char
    passed to this command should be the one whose partner you wish to find
    (not the one you want to search for).  When searching backwards (i.e.
    when trying to match a right brace), 'pos' should be the last position
    which could be a successful match, and not the position of the right
    brace itself (i.e. it will usually be the position just before the right
    brace itself).  For example if you have the text "abc ()" so that ')' is
    at position 5, then 'matchIt ) 5' will fail to match, but 'matchIt ) 4'
    will correctly return '4'.
• minPos [-w <win>] - returns the first position in the current window.  
    This will normally be '0' in Alpha 8/X, but for compatibility with 
    Alphatk (in which it is 1.0) should not be so assumed.
• maxPos [-w <win>] - returns the position of the last character in the front
    window.
• pos::nextLineStart [-w <win>] <pos> - return the position of the start of the 
    next line after position 'pos'.
• pos::diff [-w <win>] <pos1> <pos2> returns the number of characters between the two 
    positions in the window.  This will be negative if pos1 is after pos2.
• pos::math [-w <win>] <pos> ?+/- offset? ...  returns that position which is 
    given by moving the given number of characters backwards or
    forwards in the current window.  Any number of offset arguments
    may be given, with or without spaces separating the arguments.
    For future compatibility pos::math should be used in preference
    to numerical addition: positions cannot be assumed to be simple
    integers.
• pos::compare [-w <win>] <pos1> <comparison> <pos2> returns 1 or 0 depending 
    on whether the given comparison is true or not.  Valid
    comparisons include ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= etc.  For future
    compatibility, pos::compare should be used in preference to a
    direct, numerical comparison.
• pos::toRowCol [-w <win>] <pos> - converts from absolute position to row, col.
• pos::toRowChar [-w <win>] <pos> - converts from absolute position to row, char.
• pos::fromRowCol [-w <win>] <row> <col> - converts to absolute position.
    Accepts optional -w parameter that allows window to be specified.
• pos::fromRowChar [-w <win>] <row> <char> - converts to absolute position.
    Accepts optional -w parameter that allows window to be specified.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Basic insertion position movement

• backwardChar [-w <win>] - moves insertion one char back
• backwardWord [-w <win>] - moves insertion one word back
• backwardWordSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection one word back
• beginningOfBuffer [-w <win>] - move insertion to the beginning of the buffer
• beginningOfLine [-w <win>] - move insertion to the beginning of the line
• endOfBuffer [-w <win>] - move insertion to the end of the buffer
• endOfLine [-w <win>] - move insertion to the end of the line
• forwardChar [-w <win>] - move insertion one character forward
• forwardWord [-w <win>] - move insertion one word forward
• forwardWordSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection one word forward.
• goto [-w <win>] <pos> - go to the position 'pos' in the current window.
• gotoLine - prompt for a line in the current window and jump to it
    (used by clicking on line/row indicator in the status bar window).
• gotoMark [-w <win>] mark - go to named mark, use 'mark' in macros.
• gotoTMark [-w <win>] <name> - go to the temporary mark 'name'.
• matchBrace [-w <win>] - moves the insertion point to the character that 
    matches the character after the current insertion point
• nextLine [-w <win>] - move insertion point to next line
• nextSentence - go to next sentence ("textFill.tcl").
• previousLine [-w <win>] - move insertion point to the previous line
• prevSentence - go to previous sentence ("textFill.tcl").

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Basic text manipulation

• deleteText [-w <win>] <pos1> <pos2> - remove text between 'pos1' and 'pos2'
• getText [-w <win>] <pos1> <pos2> - return the text between 'pos1' and 'pos2'. 
    '-w' can be used to specify a window.
• insertText [-w <win name>] <text>* - Insert 'text' at the current insertion
    point. Mark is unchanged.
• lookAt [-w <name>] <pos> [<num>] - return the num characters at the
    'pos'th position of the current file, or the file named by <name> if 
    the '-w' option is specified. The value for num must be an integer 
    between 1 and 10 (default value is 1).
• replaceText [-w <win>] <pos1> <pos2> [text]+ - replaces the text between 'pos1'
    and 'pos2' with 'text', where 'text' can be any number of arguments. 
    The insertion position and selection are unaffected by this operation,
    but 'the mark' is set to pos1.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Selection manipulation and creation

• balance [-w <win>] - selects smallest set of parens, braces, or brackets that
    encloses the current cursor position, i.e. (), {}, and [], but not <>.
    If there is initially a selection, [balance] operates on the position
    that starts the selection.  Starting from the initial position it
    searches backward until it finds one of the enclosers: (, {, or [.  It
    ignores any of these characters which is preceded by a backslash.  When
    (if) it finds one then it looks in the other direction for the matching
    character, again ignoring escaped characters.  An error is thrown if any
    of this fails, and the cursor is returned to the initial position.
• backwardCharSelect [-w <win>] - extends selection one char back
• beginningBufferSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection to the beginning of the 
    buffer
• beginningLineSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection to the beginning of the line
• deleteSelection [-w <win>] - delete current position, don't save
• endBufferSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection to the end of the buffer
• endLineSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection to the end of line
• forwardCharSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection one character forward
• getSelect [-w <win>] - return the currently selected text, if any.
• nextLineSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection to the next line
• prevLineSelect [-w <win>] - extend selection to the previous line
• selectText [-w <win>] <pos1> <pos2> - (formerly [select].)  Selects the text
    between 'pos1' and 'pos2'.
• selEnd [-w <win>] - returns the end of the hilited selection, or the current
    insertion point if no text is selected.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Pin manipulation and creation

• exchangePointAndPin [-w <win>] - exchange the current 'pin' w/ the current 
    insertion point
• getPin [-w <win>] - return the current pin.
• hiliteToPin [-w <win>] - This is the 'Hilite' from the 'Edit' menu. If 
    there is a currently hilited selection, the selection is unhilited, 
    leaving the pin and the insertion point around the old selection. If 
    there is not a selection, the region between the insertion point and 
    the pin is selected.
• rectangularHiliteToPin [-w <win>] - creates a rectangular selection between 
    the pin and the insertion point.
• setPin [-w <win>] - set the pin position to the insertion point

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Clipboard/scrap handling

All of [copy] [cut] and [paste] and defined in AlphaTcl.
  
• alpha::copyRegion [-w <win>] - copy region
• alpha::cutRegion [-w <win>] - deletes and saves region
• alpha::pasteRegion [-w <win>] - insert the last chunk of text created by
    [alpha::cutRegion] or [alpha::copyRegion]
• clear [-w <win>] - clear selected text.  ("coreFixes.tcl")
• getScrap - returns system TEXT scrap.
• putScrap [<string>]+ - Concatenate strings together into the system 
    scrap.  The scrap can be appended to through calls of the form 'putScrap
    [getScrap] " another word"'.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Various textual manipulations
 
Former core commands which are implemented in AlphaTcl are in "textManip.tcl"
unless stated otherwise.

• backSpace [-w <win>] - delete selection, or a single char if no selection.
• backwardDeleteWord [-w <win>] - deletes previous word
• capitalizeRegion [-w <win>] - capitalize first word in selected region 
• capitalizeWord [-w <win>] - capitalize the character at the cursor location,
    and downcase the remaining text of the word to the right of the cursor,
    leaving the cursor at the end of the word.
• deleteChar [-w <win>] - delete char AFTER cursor
• deleteWord [-w <win>] - delete word after cursor
• downcaseRegion [-w <win>] - changes all letters to lowercase in current
    region.  Original region remains selected.
• downcaseWord [-w <win>] - changes all letters to lowercase in current word
    from the cursor position to the end of the word, leaving the cursor at
    the end of the word.
• fold [-w <win> (info|hide|show) ?args?] - queries or hides or shows blocks 
    of text in the given window.  This command is only available in Alphatk.
• killLine [-w <win>] - kill text from insertion point to the end of the
    line.  If the line has no text, delete the line and move succeeding lines
    up one.
• oneSpace [-w <win>] - converts whitespace surrounding insertion into a
    single space.
• openLine [-w <win>] - insert a new line following the current one and move
    the insertion point to it

• spacesToTabs [-w <win>] ?from to? - convert spaces in selection to tabs.
• tab [-w <win>] - insert a tab
• tabsToSpaces [-w <win>] ?from to? - convert tabs in selection to spaces.
• undo [-w <win>] - undo the last action that has not been undone
• upcaseRegion [-w <win>] - convert all letters to uppercase in the current
    region.  Original region remains selected.
• upcaseWord [-w <win>] - convert all letters to uppercase in the current word
	from the cursor position to the end of the word, leaving the cursor at the
    end of the word.
• wrapText [-w <win>] <pos0> <pos1> - wrap each line found in the region
    between the two positions.  (See "textFill.tcl")
• yank [-w <win>] - insert the last piece of deleted text of less than 1k. 
    Consecutive deletes are concatenated together.
• zapNonPrintables [-w <win>] - removes chars < ascii 32, except for LF's 
    and CR's.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= View/insertion interaction

• blink [-w <win>] <pos> - blink cursor at 'pos'
• centerRedraw [-w <win>] - redraw window with current line in the middle.

• scrollUpLine [-w <win>] - same action as that which occurs when the up arrow 
    in the vertical scrollbar is selected

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Dialogs for querying the user

• alert [-t stop|caution|note|plain] [-k okText] [-c cancelText] [-o otherText] 
            [-h] [-K ok|cancel|other|help] [-C ok|cancel|other|help|none]
            <error_string> [explanation_string]
    This command will display 'error_string' in a standard alert box. 
    If present, 'explanation_string' will be displayed in the small
    System font.  The dialog format will be determined by the flags:
    The '-t' flag specifies the icon that will be displayed with the
    dialog.  The '-h' flag specifies that the Help button should be
    displayed.  The '-k' flag specifies the text of the button in the
    OK position (default value is "OK").  '-c' flag specifies the text
    of the button in the Cancel position (default value is "Cancel"). 
    '-o' flag specifies the text of the button in the leftmost
    position (default value is "Don't Save").  The '-K' flag specifies
    which button acts as the default button.  The '-C' flag specifies
    which button acts as the Cancel button.  If 'cancelText' or
    'otherText' is an empty string, the corresponding button will be
    omitted.  There must be a button in the OK position and there must
    be a default button (setting the default button to 'other' and an
    empty otherText will remove the default ring, but return or enter
    will still select the OK button).  The command will return the
    name of the button that was pressed.
• alertnote <args> - display a message in a standard OS alert box.  If more
    than one argument is given, the first is displayed in boldface, and the
    remaining arguments are joined by " " and displayed in a smaller font
    below the first.  Otherwise the entire message is in a smaller font. 
    The only button in the alert box is "OK", and the return value is the
    empty string.
• askyesno [-c] <prompt> - display 'prompt' in an OS alert box with the push
    buttons Yes and No. The command will return the string "yes" or "no". 
    The '-c' flag specifies that a cancel button be used as well (with 
    return value "cancel").  On Alphatk, optional arguments '-y name -n
    name' may be specified, which change the names of the yes/no
    buttons (but the return strings are unchanged).
• buttonAlert <prompt> [<button>…] - create a dialog w/ the specified buttons,
    returning the one selected.
• colorTriple [<prompt>] [<red> <green> <blue>] - prompts the user to choose 
    color. If specified, the input RGB value is used as the initial color on 
    the colorpicker.
• dialog [<-w width>|<-h height>|<-b title l t r b>|<-c title val l t r b>|
            <-t text l t r b>|<-e text l t r b>|<-r text val l t r b>|
            ...

    Create and display a dialog.  '-w' and '-h' allow width and height of
    dialog window to be set.  '-b', '-c', '-r', '-t', '-e' and '-p' allow
    buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, static text, and editable text to be
    created, respectively.  All control types require specification of a
    title or text, together with left, top, right, and bottom coordinates.
    Checkboxes and radioboxes have an additional parameter, the default
    value.  At least one button must be specified.  The return value is a
    list containing resulting values for all buttons, radioboxes, checkboxes,
    and editable textboxes (static text is ignored).  Buttons have value '1'
    if chosen, '0' otherwise.  The dialog box exits at the first button
    press.  The arguments listed above are the ones most commonly used, but
    section 2.1 of the "Dialogs Help" .pdf file has information about the most
    current set available, as well as the optional "-tag" "-action" etc.
    arguments that allow for scripts to be called when a control is selected.

    The proc: dialog::make and the proc: dialog::make_paged make it much
    easier to create dialogs, avoiding the need to wrestle with the core
    'dialog' command directly, as described in "Dialogs Help".

• findFile [<path>] - open a file in a new window. An optional path parameter
    specifies a default directory or file.
• getControlInfo <id> <attribute> - returns the attribute value of the dialog 
    control associated with <id>, where <id> has been returned by Alpha(tk)'s
    core.  Valid values for 'attribute' are 'value', 'font', 'state'
    'contents' or 'help'.
    (Available in Alphatk and AlphaX >= 8.1a1)
• getControlValue <id> - returns the value of the dialog control associated
    with <id>, where <id> has been returned by Alpha(tk)'s core.
    (Available in Alphatk and AlphaX >= 8.1a1)
• get_directory ?-p <prompt>? ?-openPackages <num>? \
      ?-showInvisibleFiles <num>? [<default>]
    display a GetDirectory navigation dialog and request the user to select
    a folder. The command will return the selected folder's full path name,
    or an error if the Cancel button was selected. An optional path
    parameter specifies a default directory. The -p option specifies a
    prompt to display in the dialog. The other parameters have the same
    meaning as with the getfile command.
• getfile ?-types <typeslist>? ?-openPackages <num>? \
       ?-showInvisibleFiles <num>? [<prompt>] [<path>]
    display a GetFile navigation dialog and return the full path name of
    the selected file, or an error if Cancel button was selected. An
    optional path parameter specifies a default directory or file. On
    AlphaX, the -openPackages option specifies whether bundled applications
    should be seen as a folder (to make their contents accessible) or not
    and the -showInvisibleFiles option specifies whether invisible files
    should be listed in the dialog.
• getline <prompt> <default> - display an OS alert box with prompt displayed, a 
    text edit field with default initially in the field, and with the push 
    buttons OK, Cancel.. The command will return the text entered into the 
    text edit field by the user, or an empty string if the user selected the 
    Cancel button.
• listpick [options…] <list> - Display a dialog with the list displayed in a
    List Manager list.  If the user presses the Cancel button, an error is
    returned.  If the user selects the OK button, or double clicks an item in
    the list, that item will be returned.  Valid options include

      -w <width>    - the width of the dialog.
      -h <height>   - the height of the dialog.
      -p <prompt>   - the prompt text at the top of the dialog.
      -l            - allow multiple items to be selected, return a list.
      -L <def list> - a list of default item(s) to be initially selected.
                      if accompanied by -l, all items in the -L list will be
                      specified, otherwise only the first item is selected.
      -indices      - return a list of the <list> indices chosen
      --            - next arg is the list.

• prompt <prompt> <default> [<name> <menu item>*] - prompt dialog to 
    the user with a prompt string and a default value.  The prompt dialog
    can optionally include a popup menu specified by 'name' and the
    succeeding strings.  Selection of the popup menu items inserts the item
    text into the editable dialog item.  'Prompt' returns the value of the
    editable item.  If the 'Cancel' button is selected, the tcl returns an
    error and your script will be stopped unless you execute the command
    from 'catch'.
• putfile <prompt> <original> - display an SFPutFile() and return the full
    path name of the selected file, or an empty string if CANCEL button was
    selected. Original is the default name displayed for the user.
• setFontsTabs ?-w win? ?-font name? ?-fontsize size? ?-tabsize tab? - if
    none of the font/fontsize/tabsize attributes are given, then bring up a
    font and tab dialog for the specified window (or the current window if
    -w was not given).  Otherwise set the appropriate attribute of the
    appropriate window to the values given.
• setControlInfo <id> <attribute> <value> - set the attribute value of the 
    dialog control associated with <id>, where <id> has been returned by
    Alpha(tk)'s core.  Valid values for 'attribute' are 'value', 'font',
    'state' 'contents' or 'help'.  If the attribute is 'value' and if the
    value given will not fit in the available space, this command throws an
    error, the value of which is the available width, in pixels.
    (Available in Alphatk and AlphaX >= 8.1a1)
• setControlValue <id> <value> - set the value of the dialog control 
    associated with <id>, where <id> has been returned by Alpha(tk)'s core.
    If the value will not fit in the available space, this command throws
    an error, the value of which is the available width, in pixels.
    (Available in Alphatk and AlphaX >= 8.1a1)
• setRGB <col> red green blue - define one of Alpha(tk)'s colours.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Search in a window

• search [-w <win>] [options…] <pattern> <pos> - search for 'pattern' from 
    position 'pos'.  Valid options include

      -f <num>      - go forward?
      -r <num>      - regular expression?
      -i <num>      - ignore case?
      -m <num>      - match words?
      -all          - return all matches (else just first match)
      -wrap         - if the search reaches the end of the window wrap
                      around to the beginning and continue searching 
                      (similarly when searching backwards, wrap from 
                      beginning to end).
      -n            - failed search still returns TCL_OK, but null string.
      -l <limit>    - limit on how search goes.
      -s            - save previous search string and search flags (obsolete).
      --            - next arg is the pattern.

    If the search succeeds, a list of two positions will be returned,
    unless '-all' was given, when the list will contain 2 positions for
    each correct match (note: it is a flat list).  The first is the
    starting position of the match, the second is one past the last
    character.  If no '-n', an error is thrown if no match was found.
    For the regular expression syntax which may be used, see 
    "Regular Expressions".

    To search from the beginning of the buffer, use 'search -s -f 1 ...
    [minPos]' and to search backwards from the end, use 'search -s -f 0
    ...  [maxPos]'.  See also 'performSearch' which can be used for
    simulated interactive searching (where the search result is
    selected, for example).  

    'pos' is the first position at which a search may match (whether
    searching forwards or backwards). 'limit', if given, is the first
    position at which a search will not match.

    Backwards searches: The interpretation of 'pos' is such that
    backwards searches may match immediately at 'pos', in which case the
    entire matched range will be outside the apparent [limit,pos] search
    region.  This is a somewhat controversial behaviour which _may_ be
    adjusted in the future if steps can be taken to ensure none of the
    code in AlphaTcl breaks.

    Also, for various reasons, backwards searches (particularly with
    regexps) are slower than forward searches.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Using search dialog-equivalents from Tcl

Implemented entirely in AlphaTcl, see the source files "supersearch.tcl"
and "interactiveSearch.tcl".

• enterReplaceString - use current selection, if any, for future replacements
    (in search dialog).
• enterSearchString - use current selection, if any, for future searches.
• find - bring up the find dialog
• findAgain - repeat search forward
• findAgainBackward - repeat search backward
• findInNextFile - search next file.
• performSearch  [options…] <pattern> <pos> - as for 'search' but also selects
    the range of characters which are found, and ensures Alpha's internal
    state is consistent for following replace/replaceAll/...  commands.
• replace - replace the current selection
• replaceAll - replace all further occurrences in the current file or set
    of files.
• replace&FindAgain - replace the current selection and find next occurrence.
• replaceString [<str>] - specifies replacement string. Returns current 
    replacement string if no arg.
• searchString [<str>] - allows search string to be specified. Returns 
    current searchstring if no arg.
• quickFind - incremental search: searches w/o a dialog, searches as you type
    the search pattern.  Does not do regular expression searches.  'matchWords'
    automatically set to false.
• quickFindRegexp - incremental regexp search
• reverseQuickFind - reverse incremental search, see 'quickFind'.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Basic window creation and file-interaction

• edit [-r] [-c] [-w] [-mode <val>] [-encoding <val>] [-tabsize <val>] 
    [-g <l> <t> <w> <h>] [--] <name> - Open a file in new window.  '-c'
    means don't prompt for duplicate win if file already open (just
    bring to already open window to the front).  '-r' means open the
    file read-only.  The '-g' option allows left and top coords to be
    specified, plus width, and height.  All or none.  '-w' allows you to
    bypass the "Wrap" dialog for files with long rows.  This procedure
    may also be able to cope with <name> values which are not obviously
    files (e.g. remote files, .zip archives, etc) if appropriate hooks
    are activated, and may take a different action (e.g. run an
    installer) with some <name> values.  To force Alpha to open <name>
    in a new window, the more fundamental command 'editDocument' could
    be used.  However that is rarely required.  The return value of this
    command is the name of the window which was opened (or the existing
    window if a duplicate was not wanted).  Alphatk supports an
    additional [-tabbed <tabWinTitle>] argument which, if given, places
    the window as a tab inside the tabbed window which has title
    tabWinTitle.
• new [-g <l> <t> <w> <h>] [-tabsize <val>] [-mode <val>] [-dirty <val>] 
    [-shell <val>] [-info <val>] [-n <name>] - opens an untitled window. Can
    optionally provide left and top coordinates, plus width and height.
    All or none.  Alphatk supports an additional [-tabbed <tabWinTitle>] 
    argument which, if given, places the window as a tab inside the tabbed
    window which has title tabWinTitle.  If the "-info" argument is given,
    the window will be automatically locked, with "<val>" inserted as the
    text, and the cursor will be placed at the beginning of the new window.
• revert [-w <win>] - revert the file to its last saved version
• save ?<win>? - save current window, or given window.  If the window has
    never been saved, then this will be re-routed, internally, to 'saveAs'.
• saveAs ?-f? [def name] - save current window with new name. Optionally 
    takes a default filename.  Returns complete path of saved file, if ok hit,
    otherwise TCL_ERROR returned.  If '-f' flag given, then we force the save
    without any standard-file dialog.
• saveResources [win] - save resource information for current window, or 
    given window. The window must not be read-only, or a shell window, and
    needs to have a file associated with it.  The file's modification date 
    and finder information will not be changed by saving the resource 
    information. (Only available and relevant for Alpha 8/X).

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Window manager

• bringToFront <winName> - Bring named window to front.
• closeAll - close all windows
• closeFloat - close the top floating window.
• float -m <menu> [<-h|-w|-l|-t|-M> <val>] [-n winname] [-z tag] -
    Takes a created menu (not necessarily in the menubar), and makes a
    floating window out of it.  Returns integer tag that is used to remove
    the window.  With no arguments, returns all currently defined menus.
    -h through -M change width, height, left margin, top margin, and margin
    between buttons.  -z allows a ten-char tag to be specified for
    'floatShowHide'.
• floatIcon [-n <window name>] <resID> [<resID> ...] - make a little floating window
     containing small icons with the specified resource IDs.
• floatShowHide <on|off> <tag> - Shows or hides all floats w/ specified tag.
    Tags of current modes are automatically shown/hidden.
• getGeometry [-s] [win] - return a Tcl list containing the left, top, 
    width, and height of the 'content rectangle' of the current or given
    window (this includes scrollbars and text editing areas, but
    excludes the window border and title).  With the '-s' flag, returns
    the entire structure rectangle, including the window border and
    title.
• getMainDevice - return a list containing the left, top, right, and bottom
    of the rectangle defining the main device.
• getWinInfo [-w <win>] <arr> - Creates an array in current context 
    containing info about either the current or a specified window.  This
    array should be considered read-only.  It has fields 'state',
    'platform', 'read-only', 'tabsize', 'split' (if window is split, it is
    the percentage of the top pane, 0 otherwise), 'linesdisp' (num lines
    that can be seen in the window), 'currline' (first line displayed), and
    'dirty', 'font', 'fontsize' and 'encoding'.  Alphatk will also return a
    'shell' entry if that is set.  The proc: win::getInfo is the 
    preferred interface to this information.  Alpha 8/X may also provide the
    'hasSpurious' (inconsistent line endings), 'needsWrap' (some lines are
    longer than the paragraph width), 'paneNum' (which pane is active in a
    split window, 0 for top, 1 for bottom) entries.
• icon [-f <winName>] [-c|-o|-t|-q] [-g <h> <v>] - Having to do w/ 
    iconifying windows.  '-c' means close (iconify) window, '-o' open, '-t'
    toggle open/close, '-q' returns either a '1' for an iconified window or a
    '0' for an uniconified window, and '-g' moves the icon to horizontal
    position <h> and vertical position 'v'.  Options are executed as they are
    parsed, so the '-f' option, if present, should always be first.
• killWindow [-w <win>] - kill window.  This closes the current window,
    calling preCloseHook, closeHook, etc as appropriate.  Note that if the
    window is dirty (has unsaved changes), and the user accepts the closure
    of the window, then 'dirtyHook' will not be called (AlphaTcl's core 
    uses 'preCloseHook' to capture the fact that a dirty window is being
    closed, and thereby keep a correct count of the number of dirty 
    windows).
• mousePos - Returns list <row,col> of mouse position, if the mouse is 
    currently over the active window.  Otherwise, return error (catch w/
    'catch').
• moveWin [win name] <left> <top> - moves current or specified window. 
    The window name can be "StatusWin".  This command attempt to move
    the window so the top-left corner of the window contents (not
    including the titlebar) is at the specified position.  Alpha may 
    constrain the action to ensure the window is onscreen.
• otherPane [-w <win>] - If window is split, select the other pane.
• saveAll - save all currently open windows.
• setWinInfo [-w <win>] <field> <arg> - Sets a piece of data about either 
    the current or a specified window.  Settable fields:
     platform     - lineendings for the window (mac/unix/dos)
     read-only    - is the window editable?
     tabsize      - character widths used for the tab character (\t)
     dirty        - does the window contain unsaved changes/edits.
     font         - the font name used for the window's contents
     fontsize     - the font size used for the widnow's contents
     shell        - if set, means that dirty flag and undo/redo is ignored
     state        - (ignored by Alphatk)
	 colortags    - list of tags for colouring of keywords
	 bindtags     - list of tags for keyboard bindings
	 wordbreak    - the regexp defintion of the end of a word 
    Alphatk also provides 
     encoding     - the character encoding which will be used to save this
                    window to disk
     linenumbers  - show a margin on the left edge of the window showing
                    line numbers.
     horscrollbar - include a horizontal scrollbar in the window
     wrap         - controls real soft wrapping (none/char/word)
    The proc: win::setInfo is the preferred interface to this information. 
    Alpha 8/X may also provide the 'hasSpurious' (inconsistent line endings), 
    and 'needsWrap' (some lines are longer than the paragraph width) entries.
• sizeWin [win name] <width> <height> - sets size of current or specified window.
    The window name can be "StatusWin", although only the width can be changed.
    This command attempt to adjust the size of the window contents (not
    including the titlebar) to the specified size.  Including the
    titlebar, the height will of course be larger than that given.  In 
    addition, Alpha may have minimum and maximum allowed sizes, which
    will be applied as constraints to the given width, height.
• toggleSplitWindow [-w <win>] [percent] - toggle having window split into 
    two panes. Optional arg specifies percent of window to allocate to the 
    first pane. 
• toggleScrollbar [-w <win>] - toggles horizontal scrollbar on frontmost window. 
    Will not succeed if scrollbar scrolled.
• unfloat <float num> - removes specified floating window. W/ no options 
    lists all floating windows.
• windowVisibility [-w <win>] ?<hidden|normal|minimized>? - get or set the
    visibility state of a window: it is one of hidden, normal, or
    minimized. If the last argument is not specified, the command returns
    the current state.
• wins - return window boundaries for all windows.
• winNames [-f] - return a list of all open windows, ordered from 
    frontmost window to backmost window, followed by any windows which are
    not really ordered (e.g. minimized, hidden windows, or those which are
    in the process of being created).  If the '-f' option is specified,
    complete pathnames are returned.  In both cases, when any window's name
    (as shown in the Open Windows menu) is not unique, ' <n>' (n = 2,3...)
    is added to the window name to ensure a unique final path component.
    This can be removed (on an element by element basis) with
    'win::StripCount'.  The first element of this list is always the same
    as [win::Current].  The order of iconified/minimized windows is not
    necessarily defined, so they may just be listed, for example, in an
    arbitrary order after all normal windows.
• win::Current - returns the full name of the current window, or the empty
    string if no windows are currently open.  This is always the same as
    [lindex [winNames -f] 0].  Note that if a window is currently in the
    process of being opened (e.g. this function is called from, e.g., 
    openHook) then [win::Current] will not necessarily return the new
    window name (for example it might be being opened in a hidden state).
• zoom - zooms the current window

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Menu creation/manipulation

• addHelpMenu <item> - add 'item' to the OS Help menu. No menu conversion
    done, i.e. all items appear as given without being massaged in any way.
    In Alpha8/X/tk, 'item' can be a submenu created with the 'Menu' command.
• addMenuItem [-m] [-l <meta-characters>] <menu name> <item name> - Convert
    item to menu form and add to specified menu.  If '-m' specified, menu form
    conversion not done.  The '-l' option allows you to use menu meta
    characters as text of menu items.  If the '-l' option is used, the
    <meta-characters> string is interpreted for menu item attributes, and
    meta-characters in <item name> are included in the menu item text
    literally.  For example:
      addMenuItem -m -l "/B" "Hello/C" 
    would appear as the text "Hello/C" in the menu, and have "B" as its 
    command equivalent.
• deleteMenuItem [-m] <menu name> <item name> - Convert item to menu form 
    and delete from specified menu.  If '-m' specified, menu form conversion
    not done.
• enableMenuItem [-m] <menuName> <item text> <on|off> - Either enable or 
    disable the menu item of user menu 'menuName' that has text '<item text>'. 
    Note that unless the menu is not only created, but also already inserted,
    this command has no effect.
• insertMenu <name> ?<name>...? - insert the previously created user 
    menu(s) given by the 'name' argument(s) into the menuBar. 
• markMenuItem [-m] <menuName> <item text> <on|off> [<mark char>] - 
    Either mark or unmark the menu item of user menu 'menuName' that has text
    '<item text>'.  Note that unless the menu is not only created, but also
    already inserted, this command has no effect.
• Menu [-i <num][-m] [-M <mode>]  [-n <name|num>] [-p <procname>] [-s] <list> -
    Defines a new menu named 'name' (if provided w/ '-n' option) with items
    'list'.  The menu is not yet inserted into the menubar.  The menu
    commands may be nested for heirarchical menus, such as in the filesets
    menus.  By default Alpha massages the item names in the 'list' to make them 
    look better in the menus.

      -c            Ignore any menu meta-chars. Can also be done on a per-item
                    basis by appending an ampersand ('&') to the end of an item.
      -m            No menu form. If not supplied, each menu item is split into 
                    words at each capitalized letter.
      -M <mode>     Specifies that any bindings created by the menu are 
                    specific to a given mode.  This is important because
                    mode-specific bindings over-ride global bindings.
      -n <name>     Name the menu. Not necessary for submenus.
      -n <num>      Resource id of icon suite to use for menu title. 'ics#' 
                    is the only resource that is really necessary.
      -p <name>     The tcl proc named by 'name' is called w/ the menu's name
                    and the item's contents when the item is chosen.
      -s            Use system menu definition proc (faster).
    
    See the "Extending Alpha # Menu Creation Syntax" section for more
    information about meta characters which can be used for individual items.

• menu::inserted <name> - is the given menu 'name' currently inserted into
    the menubar.
• removeMenu <name> ?<name>...? - remove menu(s) given by the 'name' 
    argument(s) from the menubar.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Inter-application communication

-- See TclAE Help

• icGetPref [<-t <type>] <pref name> - Gets preference from 
    Internet Config.  '-t' allows type to be set, '0' returns a string
    (default), '1' returns a path name, commonly used for helper apps.  A <pref
    name> of 'all' returns all valid preferences.
• icOpen - Opens Internet Config
• launch -f <name> - launch the named app into the background. Note that 
    for some yet unexplained reason, some applications (MicroSoft Word) won't
    launch completely in the background.  'launch'ing such applications won't
    insert the application into any system menu that specifies running
    applications (although "About the Finder..."  will list it.  The only way
    to get to such an app is through Alpha's 'switchTo', after which the
    application will finish launching.  The '-f' option gets around this by
    launching the application in the foreground instead.
• nameFromAppl '<app sig>' - Interrogates the desktop database for the first 
    existing app that has the desired signature.  <app sig> is four chars
    inside single quotes.  Returns the full path to the executable.
• processes - returns info of active processes. A list of lists, each 
    sublist contain a file-name, an application signature, the application
    memory size, and the number of ticks the application has been active.
• switchTo <appName> - Switches to application 'appName'.
• sendOpenEvent [filler] <app name> <file name> - Send an open doc event to 
    another currently running application.  If 'filler' is noReply, then a
    reply is not requested.  Otherwise, we wait for a reply and 'filler' is
    ignored.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Keyboard bindings and codes

• ascii <char> [<modifier>] <script> [<mode>] - bind the given character
    with optional modifiers to the specified script, optionally for only
    a given mode.  <char> is a Tcl integer giving the character code
    corresponding to that key.  <modifier> is, if it is present, a string
    specifying which additional modifier keys that must be pressed for
    the binding to be activated.  The first character of this string must
    be < and the last must be >.  Remaining characters correspond to
    modifier keys as follows:


          c   - command modifier
          o   - option modifier
          s   - shift modifier
          z   - control modifier
          e   - escape modifier (activated by the startEscape command)
          A-Z - any capitalized character, for a control-<char> prefix
                (activated by the prefixChar command)


    <script> is any Tcl script, usually a procedure call, that will be
    evaluated whenever the bound key combination is pressed.  <mode> is,
    if present, the name of the mode in which this binding should take
    effect.  If there is no <mode> argument then the binding will be
    global.  See "Keyboard Shortcuts" for more information.
• Bind <char> [<modifier>] <script> [<mode>] - bind the given character
    with optional modifiers to the specified script, optionally for only a
    given mode.  <char> specifies one of (1) a Tcl integer with the character
    code as in 'ascii', (2) a particular key either as an explicit character
    with a straight single quote (apostrophe) on both sides, such as 'a', or
    (3) a "special" key such as Enter, Home, etc.  The string '\r' (including
    the single quotes) can be used to bind the Return key.  The Tab key can
    only be bound using "0x30" (without the double quotes).  See the
    explanation under "ascii" for more information, and the help file
    "Keyboard Shortcuts" for a complete list of special keys and examples.
• bindingList [<mode>] - return list of bindings. The optional <mode> 
    argument restricts the output to the bindings specific to that mode.
    It can be "global" which is equivalent to the command with no option.
• deleteModeBindings <mode> - Delete all bindings for specified mode.
• describeBinding - display the binding of the next typed key sequence. 
• getAscii - displays the ASCII code for character at current insertion point
• getChar - waits for a keystroke, returns ascii.
• getModifiers - returns current modifiers mask. "OR" of several values, 
    cmdKey                      = 0x01,      /* Bit 0 of high byte */
    shiftKey                    = 0x02,      /* Bit 1 of high byte */
    alphaLock                   = 0x04,      /* Bit 2 of high byte */
    optionKey                   = 0x08,      /* Bit 3 of high byte */
    controlKey                  = 0x10,      /* Bit 4 of high byte */
    rightShiftKey               = 0x20,      /* Bit 5 of high byte */
    rightOptionKey              = 0x40,      /* Bit 6 of high byte */
    rightControlKey             = 0x80,      /* Bit 7 of high byte */
• insertAscii - prompt for an ASCII code and insert into text.
• keyAscii - insert ascii representation (in decimal) of the keydown event,
    plus a modifier string, if necessary.
• keyCode - insert the key code along w/ a string representing and modifiers
    into the current window. Used by the Alpha Dev menu to create bindings.
• prefixChar ?msg msg? - used to further modify the next keystroke
    combination.  If any arguments are given, they are used to form a 
    message presented to the user in the status bar when this keystroke
    is triggered (if none are given then 'Prefix ...' is the message).
• startEscape - used to further modify the next keystroke combination,
    in the same manner as using the shift key in the next keystroke
• unascii <char> [<modifier>] <script> [<mode>] - unbind the ascii
    character previously bound using 'ascii'
• unBind <char> [<modifier>] <script> [<mode>] - unbind the keyboard 
    character previously bound using 'Bind'.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Status window

• displayMode <mode> - Up to four characters of the 'mode' string are 
    displayed in the status line at the bottom of a window.  Note
    that in Alpha 8/X at present this will throw an error if passed 
    the empty string.  In Alphatk an empty string will lead to the removal
    of the popup mode, wrap, encoding, etc. menus from the status bar.
• displayPlatform <string> - Sets the text string to show as the label in
    the menu button which controls the 'platform' popup menu in the status
    bar.  Typically this is used internally by AlphaTcl to set this label
    to one of 'mac', 'unix' or 'dos' to reflect the current window's
    line-endings (mac = CR, unix = LF, dos = CRLF).  To change the
    line-endings in use for the current window, see 'setWinInfo'.
• displayWrap <string> - Sets the text string to show as the label in the
    menu button which controls the 'line wrap' popup menu in the status bar.
    Typically it is used internally by AlphaTcl to set this label to one of
    'none', or 'auto' (additionally 'visual-char', 'visual-word' in
    Alphatk).  To change the actual wrap style of the current window, set
    your mode's 'Line Wrap' preference.
• displayEncoding <string> - Sets the text string to show as the label in the
    menu button which controls the 'encoding' popup menu in the status bar.
    Typically it is used internally by AlphaTcl to set this label to the
    current window's encoding ('macRoman', 'utf-8', etc).  This is only
    available in Alphatk.
• execute - prompt user for a function or macro. The tab key acts as a
    "completion" command.
• status::msg <string> - prints 'string' on the status line.  (This
    should be used in preference to the older 'message' which conflicts
    with Tk).
• statusPrompt <prompt> [<func>] - Prompt in the status window. If 'func' 
    is present, call this routine at each key-press with the current contents
    of the status line and the key, insert into statusline whatever is returned
    by the func.  Command-v pastes the current (<80 char) clipboard contents on
    the status line.  Also see the proc: status::prompt which is more flexible.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Filesystem

• getFileInfo <file> <arr> - Given a file or folder name, creates an array
    called 'arr' in the current context, containing fields 'created',
    'modified', 'creator', 'type', 'datalen', and 'resourcelen'. These last
    four fields are ignored in the case of a directory. 'created' and
    'modified' are in a form suitable for the command 'mtime'. On Alphatk
    with non-MacOS platforms, the 'type' entry is always 'TEXT' and the
    'creator' entry is just the <file> given. On AlphaX, there is a
    'bundle' field to tell whether the item is a bundle (directory
    displayed as a file) or not. There is also a 'hidden' field indicating
    if the file is visible or not. Most (all in Tcl 8.5) fields of
    getFileInfo can be accessed through 'file attributes', 'file mtime'
    etc., which are preferred.
• ls - unix style directory listing, described in "Shells"
• setFileInfo <file> <field> [arg] - set some information for files.
    Settable fields are 'modified', 'created', 'creator', and 'type'. All
    take an argument except 'resourcelen' which just removes the resource
    fork. 'file' is a complete pathname. On AlphaX, there is a 'hidden'
    field to make the file invisible in the Finder. Most (all in Tcl 8.5)
    fields of setFileInfo can be accessed through 'file attributes', 'file
    mtime' etc., which are preferred.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Debugging

• echo <string>* - echo the strings (used in shells).
• evaluate [-w <win>] ?script? - evaluates given text, else hilited text, 
   or entire window if nothing is hilited.  'evaluat'ing means that whatever 
   Tcl code (procs, bindings or macro definitions etc) is present in the 
   evaluated text take effect
• tclShell - open the Tcl shell.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Colours

• colorTagKeywords [options] <colortag> <keyword list> - Set keywords 
    to color for the given tag. Valid options are:
   
       -a			  Keywords will be *added* to existing <colortag>
                   keywords.  The new keywords can be a different
                   color to older keywords.
       -k <color>		Keyword color.
       -C          All keywords for this colortag are case-sensitive.
     
    No other options are allowed.  This command may be evaluated 
    repeatedly for a given colortag, to declare multiple sets of
    color+keywords.  However the '-C' flag applies to all keywords
    with all colours, and need therefore only be given once -- it
    should be given (or not, if undesired) the first time that 
    colorTagKeywords is called for the given colortag.  So a typical
    usage will be:
    
      colorTagKeywords -C foo {}
      colorTagKeywords -a -k blue foo {list of keywords}
      colorTagKeywords -a -k magenta foo {list of keywords}

    (This command is only in Alphatk 8.3fc5 and Alpha 8.0b16 or newer,
    and in Alpha 8/X there is a limit of 20 characters for <colortag> and
    of 40 characters for any individual keyword)
• dumpColors - dump current foreground and background colors into the
    current buffer in Alpha-readable format.
• getColors [-w <win>] - returns list of colors/hypertext for current document
    or for the window specified with the -w option. Format is list of lists, 
    each sublist consisting of file offset, color index, and possibly a 
    hypertext command.
• insertColorEscape [-w <win>] <pos> <color ind> [hypertext func] - Create a 
    color or style "point" for documentation purposes.  Look at the file
    "colorsMenu.tcl" for examples.  The hypertext func is only used when the
    "point" is underlined.  See 'getColors' for info about the current file. 
    You should now use the proc: text::color and the proc: text::hyper instead
    of this function.
• refresh [-w <win>] - redraw the window colours, required in Alpha8/X after
    applying colours with [text::color], this is a dummy proc in Alphatk.
• regModeKeywords [options] <mode> <keyword list> - Set keywords and comments
    that Alpha can recognize to color them.  Specifically, in mode <mode>,
    every keyword specified in the list is colored non-black (blue, by
    default).  Comments, if specified by '-e' or '-b' below, are colored red by
    default.    Each keyword must be shorter than 40 characters in Alpha8/X.

      -a              Keywords will be *added* to existing mode keywords.
                      The new keywords can be a different color than older
                      keywords.  This flag can also be used to modify other
                      attributes.
      -b <beg> <end>  Specify a pair of strings that bracket a comment.
      -C              Keywords are case sensitive.  When used it should be 
                      the first regModeKeywords statement done in a mode.  
                      Use an empty <keyword list> e.g. {}, like
                      this 'regModeKeywords -C Tcl {}' 
      -c <color>      Comment color.
      -e <commentstr> Specify a string that begins comments that last to 
                      the end of the line.
      -f <color>      'Function' color, which will color any word preceding '('
      -i <char>       Specify a character to display differently.
                      Commonly used for curly braces, etc.
      -I <color>      Color of above characters.
      -k <color>      Keyword color.
      -m <c>          Specify a magic character. Every word beginning with the 
                      magic character is a keyword.
      -s <color>      String color. Alpha8/X can color single-line strings only,
                      using the simple heuristic of assuming the first two double
                      quotes constitute a string.

• removeColorEscapes [-w <win>] - remove color escapes from topmost window.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Keyboard macros

• iterationCount - allows actions to be repeated many times. 
    "control-u 44 =" inserts 44 '='s into current window.  Also can be used to
    execute any function or macro (including the keyboard macro) many times. 
    Defaults to 4.
• macro::current - return the most recently recorded keyboard macro as a proc.
• macro::endRecording - stop recording keyboard macro
• macro::execute - execute the current keyboard macro
• macro::startRecording - start recording keyboard macro
• macro::recording - are we currently recording?

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Time related

• cvttime - convert input time to/from some epoch (+/- 0x7c25b080).
• mtime <time> [long|short|abbrev] - return a date and time string using 
    the Macintosh International Utilities.  The long/short/abbrev specification
    corresponds to the date.  These are the following formats:

      short     3/16/92 9:20:46 PM
      abbrev    Mon, Mar 16, 1992 9:20:49 PM
      long      Monday, March 16, 1992 9:20:43 PM

    The returned value actually is in the form of a list.  To get text as
    above, run the result through 'join', as in "join [mtime [now] short]".
• now - return the current time as Macintosh seconds. This is the number
    of seconds that have elapsed since Midnight Jan 1, 1904.
• ticks - return the current TickCount. Ticks are 60ths of a seconds.
    TickCount is the number of ticks since the Macintosh was started.  The
    command:

      puts stdout [expr "[ticks] / 60"]

    will print the number of seconds since the Macintosh was booted.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Marks

• createTMark [-w <win>] <name> <pos> - create a temporary 'mark' at 
    location 'pos'. 
• getNamedMarks [-w <win>] [-n] - return list of all permanent marks
    in open files.  Each element of a list describes one mark as a sublist of
    the mark's name, the complete pathname of the mark's file, the position of
    the first character in the first line displayed, the current position, and
    the end of the selection if text is hilited, or the current position again
    if there is no hilited section.  '-w' allows window name to be applied as
    filter, '-n' means only names will be returned.
• getTMarks [-w <win>] - return a list of temporary marks. Each item of the 
    returned list is a sublist containing the mark name, the complete pathname 
    of the mark, and the start and finish of the selection named by the mark.  
    The following is an example of the result:

      {{temp1 External:file.c 1312 1315} {temp2 Internal:it.h 111 111}} 

• removeNamedMark [-w window] [-n name] - remove a mark previously set by 
     'setNamedMark'.  If neither -w nor -n are specified, presents the user with
     a dialog containing all marks from all open windows.  If only -w is
     specified, presents the user with a dialog containing all marks from the
     specified window.  If both -w and -n are specified, the mark 'name' is
     removed from 'window'.  If only -n is specified, the mark 'name' is removed
     from the current window.
• removeTMark [-w <win>] <name> - remove temporary mark.
• setNamedMark [-w <win>] [name disp pos end] - set named mark. If 
    optional arguments are present, the mark is created without prompting
    user.  'disp' is the character position of the start of the first
    line to be displayed, while 'pos' and 'end' bracket the text to be
    selected.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Remaining commands

(in alphabetical order) -- 

  some of these still need placing in other sections of this document.

• abbreviateText <font> <string> <width> - return an abbreviated string that
    will fit in the given pixel-length specificed by "width".  The "font"
    argument can be either an integer or a font name.  In the case of an
    integer, it is precisely a theme font ID. Allowable values include these
    specified below in the command: getTextDimensions .  It is possible to
    use either the integer value or its symbolic name.  So, for instance, one
    can use either:

	abbreviateText kThemeLabelFont $HOME 125
	abbreviateText 6 $HOME 125
	
    Limited support for using Font names (such as monaco or geneva) exists
    but is discouraged to ensure cross-platform compatibility; integers from
    the set {0 1 2 3} are fully supported in both AlphaX and Alphatk.

• abortEm - aborts whatever is currently happening
• addAlphaChars <chars> - Add <chars> to the list of characters that internally 
    are caught by the 'isalnum' and 'isalpha' calls.  Can be used to augment
    the list of characters that the \w pattern in a regular expression responds
    to.  Use w/ care.  (only supported in Alpha 8/X).
• tags::createFile - In "tags.tcl".
• tags::find - In "tags.tcl".
• beep [-volume num] [-list | sndName]? where -volume and -list are switches,
    while num and sndName are variables. Example:  
      beep -volume 3 "click in set 5"
    will play at volume 3 the sound named "click in set 5" in the Alpha's snd
    resource.  Any sound stored in that resource can be used as well, so feel
    free to paste a sound (with ResEdit) in the snd resource to have it
    available.
• breakIntoLines <string> [fillColumn [leftFillColumn]] - return 'string' 
    with carriage returns and spaces inserted to satisfy 'leftFillColumn' 
    and 'fillColumn' variables (unless values are given for these).
    ("paragraphs.tcl")
• getTextDimensions [options] <text> - returns the rectangular 
    bounds of <text> in pixels. Bounds are returned as 
    {left ascent right descent} around the (0,0) origin 
    of the line of text. The font, size and display width can be
    specified with the following options (later options override 
    earlier ones). If not otherwise specified, the default font 
    and size are used.  If '-width' is given, then newlines will
    trigger the creation of a new line in the height calculation, but 
    otherwise they will be treated just as spaces.  Currently tabs 
    are treated as the size of an ordinary character.

      -w <win>        Use the font and size of the specified window
      -font <font>    Use the specified font (integer or name). 
                      Special Appearance Manager meta fonts (which

                       108 or kThemeToolbarFont
					   200 or kThemeCurrentPortFont

      -size <size>    Point size (positive integer). Whether 
                      given earlier or later, if an Appearance 
                      Manager meta font is specified, this size
                      setting is ignored.
      -width <width>  Measure the text in a box of specified width,
                      wrapped to as many lines as necessary.
                      If this option is missing or set to zero, the
                      bounds of the text as a single line is returned.

    This command introduced in 8.0b9. Not available on 68k.
• getThemeMetrics <arr> - Fills <arr> with the sizes of the 
    interface elements in the current environment. This command 
    introduced in 8.0b9.  It populates the array with the following
    keys (some of these are not currently produced on Alphatk, but
    they will be in the future):

    ScrollBarWidth: The width of a scroll bar.  For horizontal scroll
    bars, this measurement is actually the scroll bar height.

    SmallScrollBarWidth: The width of a small scroll bar.  For
    horizontal scroll bars, this measurement is actually the scroll bar
    height.

    CheckBoxHeight: The height of the non-label part of a check box
    control.

    RadioButtonHeight: The height of the non-label part of a radio
    button control.

    EditTextWhitespace: The amount of white space surrounding the text
    rectangle of the text inside of an Edit Text control.  If you select
    all of the text in an Edit Text control, this white space is
    visible.  The metric is the number of pixels, per side, that the
    text rectangle is outset to create the whitespace rectangle.

    EditTextFrameOutset: The thickness of the Edit Text frame that
    surrounds the whitespace rectangle (which surrounds the text
    rectangle).  The metric is the number of pixels, per side, that the
    frame rectangle is outset from the whitespace rectangle.

    ListBoxFrameOutset: The number of pixels that the list box frame is
    outset from the content of the list box.

    FocusRectOutset: This is a deprecated metric and you should not use
    it.  This metric describes how far from a control the focus
    rectangle was drawn, but control focus drawing no longer uses this
    information.

    ImageWellThickness: The thickness of the frame drawn by
    DrawThemeGenericWell.

    ScrollBarOverlap: The number of pixels a scrollbar should overlap
    any bounding box which surrounds it and scrollable content.  This
    also includes the window frame when a scrollbar is along an edge of
    the window.

    LargeTabHeight: The height of the large tab of a tab control.

    LargeTabCapsWidth: The width of the caps, or end pieces, of the
    large tabs of a tab control.

    TabFrameOverlap: The amount you must add to the tab height,
    kThemeMetricLargeTabHeight, to find the rectangle height to use with
    the various tab drawing primitives.  This amount is also the amount
    that each tab overlaps the tab pane.

    TabIndentOrStyle: If less than zero, this indicates that the text
    should be centered on each tab.  If greater than zero, the text
    should be justified, according to the system script direction, and
    the amount is the offset from the edge at which the text should
    start drawing.

    TabOverlap: The amount of space that every tab's drawing rectangle
    overlapsthat of the tab on either side of it.

    SmallTabHeight: The height of the small tab of a tab control.  This
    includes the pixels that overlap the tab pane and/or tab pane bar.

    SmallTabCapsWidth: The width of the caps, or end pieces, of the
    small tabs of a tab control.

    PushButtonHeight: The height and the width of the push button
    control.

    ListHeaderHeight: The height of the list header field of the data
    browser control.

    DisclosureTriangleHeight: The height of a disclosure triangle
    control.  This triangle is the not the center of the disclosure
    button, but its own control.

    DisclosureTriangleWidth: The width of a disclosure triangle control.

    LittleArrowsHeight: The height of a little arrows control.

    LittleArrowsWidth: The width of a little arrows control.

    PopupButtonHeight: The height of a popup button control.

    HSliderTickHeight: The height of the tick marks for a horizontal
    slider control.

    VSliderWidth: The width of the vertical slider control.

    VSliderTickWidth: The width of the tick marks for a vertical slider
    control.

    TitleBarControlsHeight: The height of the title bar widgets (grow,
    close, and zoom boxes) for a document window.

    CheckBoxWidth: The width of the non-label part of a check box
    control.

    RadioButtonWidth: The width of the non-label part of a radio button
    control.

    NormalProgressBarThickness: The height of the normal progress bar,
    not including its shadow.

    ProgressBarShadowOutset: The number of pixels of shadow depth drawn
    below the progress bar.

    SmallProgressBarShadowOutset: The number of pixels of shadow depth

• linkVar - link a Tcl variable to a preexisting internal variable of the
    same name (only meaningful on Alpha 7/8/X).
• pageSetup - display the printing PageSetup dialog.
• print ?win? - print front window
• quit - quits ALPHA
• version - Return string of the form "AlphaX 8.0a8, Sunday, 23 March 2003"
• watchCursor - turns the cursor into a a watch cursor.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Uncommon/unused commands

Probably best to avoid using these.

• specToPathName [hex data] - given an FSSpec in hex form (as that 
    returned by AEbuild, for instance), return a complete pathname.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------

= Obsolete (and possibly buggy)

These WILL be removed in Alpha 8.

• AEBuild [<flags>] <app (name|creator)> <aesuite> <aeevent> [<event parameters>]*  -
    *** Deprecated in favor of [tclAE::send], "TclAE Help" ***
    Build and send an apple-event.  'AEBuild' is apple's code of the same name. 
    Each "event parameter" is two parameters, a parameter type and the data for
    the parameter.  See the "AEGizmos" help file for more details. Flags include:

      -r            Wait for reply.
      -q            Queue reply, in which case 'handleReply' (in appleEvents.tcl)
                    is called with the reply as a parameter.
      -t <timeout>  Specifies the timeout in ticks.
• dosc [<-c 'sign' | -n appName>] [-k 'clas'] [-e 'evnt'] <-s string | -f fileName> [<-t timeout|-r>]
    *** Deprecated in favor of [tclAE::send], "TclAE Help" ***
    Send an AppleEvent, by default class 'misc', event 'dosc'.

      -c 'sign'     "sign" is a four-letter creator signature of a
                    running application.
      -n appName    "appName" is the name of a running application.
      -k 'clas'     "clas" is a four-letter event class.
      -e 'evnt'     "evnt" is a four-letter event class.
      -s string     "string" is the text of a script to send to the other app.
      -f fileName   "fileName" is the complete or relative pathname of a file
                    the other application should execute.
      -t timeout    "timeout" is the number of ticks Alpha should wait for
                    a response. A timeout of "0" means wait forever.
      -r            Do not wait for reply.
      -q            Queue reply.
           
    If neither of the '-c' and '-n' options is chosen, the PPC Browser is used. 
    Either '-s' or '-f' must be chosen.  Thus, you can have "Alpha 5.02" and
    "Alpha 5.02 Copy" sending Apple events to each other, or they can send
    events to a remote server such as Apple's ToolServer.
• eventHandler [class] [event] [proc] 
    *** Deprecated in favor of [tclAE::installEventHandler], "TclAE Help" ***
    Register 'proc' to handle the class and event specified.  Class and
    event are each 4 char args.  'proc' takes a single argument that
    specifies the incoming event according to the syntax here.  There is
    currently no provision for a reply.
• icURL <URL> - passes arg to Internet Config, if present. Error if not 
    present.  You should use 'url::execute' instead (icURL is deprecated).
• largestPrefix <list> - return the longest prefix contained in all 
    strings of 'list'.
