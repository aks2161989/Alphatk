	  	Introduction


A "fileset" is simply a method or set of rules to create a list of files.
This list can then be used for several different purposes.  The most basic
usage is to present the list of files so that one of them can be opened for
editing.  The "Fileset Menu" will present the contents of most filesets in a
drop-down menu; selecting any one of them will open the file in Alpha.

Preferences: Menus

Filesets are also used to create lists of files for multiple-file searches
and tag searches, among other things.  Typically, a user will set up
several different file sets, such as:

  • all html files in a web site
  • all source files in a programming project
  • a local image of a remote cvs code repository
  • all files on a remote ftp site
  • all documents in a multi-part LaTeX document

Each fileset is composed of a set of criteria to create a list.  These
criteria can be as simple as

	All files recursively contained within a given directory

or

	All of the files in this specific list

or there can be more complex membership rules such as

	All of the files in a given hierarchy
	Including those whose names begin with "draft"
	But excluding those whose names end with ".log" and ".aux"

The Fileset Menu allows you to include the listing of your commonly used
filesets: each one will appear as a submenu whose label is the name of the
fileset (which you specify when you create the fileset), and whose contents
are the names of the files within the fileset.  Selecting an item in the
menu will open the file for editing.  For each fileset you create, you may
also decide not to place it in the menu but rather to have it hidden.
Hidden filesets are fully functional in every way to every other part of
Alpha which interacts with filesets; they are simply not shown in the menu.

In fact Alpha automatically creates some special filesets which you can use,
but which do not appear in the filesets menu.  One of these is a fileset
containing all recently used files; another is a fileset containing all
currently open windows --- these can be very useful for search operations, for
example.  The reason these filesets are not shown in the filesets menu is that
they are updated very frequently, and already feature in the Windows and
Recent-Files menus.


	  	Activating the Fileset menu


The Fileset menu, like all of Alpha's menus, is activated in the dialog
"Config > Global Setup > Menus".  

Preferences: Menus

Check the 'Fileset Menu' box among the global menus, and it should appear
in the menu bar.  For new users it is automatically activated, so it should
already be in the menu bar.  If icons are used in your menu bar, this menu
looks like a stack of overlapping documents.  If icons are not used, then
this menu is simply called 'Fileset'.


	  	Getting started


As an introductory example this section describes how to create a new fileset
with all files in a folder.  (See the "# Fileset types" section below for
information about the proper settings for other types of filesets.)

• Create a new fileset by selecting "Filesets Menu > Utilities > New Fileset"
  (click here <<newFileset>> for an example.

• You are now asked for the name and type of the fileset you want.  Let's
  give it the name 'My fileset', and for the type, we'll use 'From Directory'
  (the default) since we wish to create a fileset with the files in a
  directory.  Assuming you want to keep this fileset permanently, don't click
  the box saying this is a temporary fileset.

• You are now presented with a dialog from which you can set all aspects of
  this fileset.  The most important is to select the folder/directory
  containing files you might like quick access to.  Click on the 'Set...'
  button to do this.

• Next you need to give a pattern for the fileset, specifying which files in
  the folder to include in the fileset.  To include all files use the default
  pattern '*' (or leave the pattern empty).  See the section File Patterns in
  the Alpha manual ("Alpha Manual # File Patterns") to learn how to specify
  file patterns.

• There are a number of other options in the dialog, which we will ignore
  for the moment.  Once you are done, click on 'OK'.

Alpha now builds a new submenu of the Fileset menu called 'My fileset' with
all the files in the folder you selected.  Selecting a file in the submenu
will open the file in Alpha.

Your fileset can also be used for multi-file searching.  In the Find dialog
when selecting multi file searching, you can choose to search the files in
your fileset.

You can also do multi file search and replace in your fileset, by selecting
"Filesets Menu > Utilities > Replace In Fileset".


	  	Fileset types


Some fileset types require that you give file patterns specifying which files
to include in the fileset.  Read the Section File Patterns in the Alpha manual
to learn about how to specify file patterns.

	From Directory          

The basic type: create a fileset of all files in a given folder which match a
given pattern.  You have to specify:

• The folder with the files.
• A file pattern matching the files to include.
• A list of patterns of files to exclude.
                        
	From Hierarchy          

Takes the above one step further and allows filesets to include all files in a
nested set of folders.  You have to specify:

• The base folder with the files.
• The depth of nested folders.
• A file pattern matching the files to include.
• A list of patterns of files to exclude.

	Recurse In              

A simplification of 'From Hierarchy' which includes all files contained in the
given base folder.  Hence you only need to specify:

• The base folder with the files.

	From Open Windows       

Make a fileset containing all currently open windows.

	Codewarrior             

Query the Codewarrior IDE for a list of all files in the current project (Only
available on MacOS).

	Tex                     

Make a fileset of all parts of a multi-part TeX/LaTeX document.  Alpha's
LaTeX mode understands these and will automatically send your TeX application
the base .tex/.ltx file when you select 'Typeset' on any component part.
Details about TeX filesets can be found in the LaTeX mode documentation; see
the "Help > LaTeX Mode Help" menu item for more information.

	Ftp                     

Make a fileset of files at a remote machine via ftp.  You have to specify:

  • Host, path (optional), user id, and password
  • A regular expression (not a file pattern!) matching the files to include.

	Procedural              

Make a fileset from a Tcl procedure.  This type requires that you write a Tcl
procedure which returns a list of paths to all files in the fileset.  When you
create a new procedural fileset Alpha puts an empty procedure (with the
correct name!)  in your global preferences file.  You must then write the body
of this procedure.  Procedural filesets are completely dynamic and will not
appear in the Fileset menu.


	  	Non-text files


This setting only applies on MacOS and MacOS X. By default only text files
are included in the fileset (i.e. files whose 'type' attribute is designated
as 'TEXT').  If the flag 'Include Non Text Files' is set, the fileset menu
may contain files Alpha is not designed to open; these are sent to the Finder
which will open them using whichever application created them.  A common use
of this feature is a hierarchical fileset containing a complete C or C++
project.  Selecting any project source file will open that file for editing,
and selecting the project file/debugging symbol file/...  will open that
using appropriate tool (Symantec Project Manager or Codewarrior IDE or
Debugger,…) Another use can be to include images in a home page so you can
quickly open them when you want to change the graphics.


	  	Fileset menu cache


Rather than rebuilding the Fileset menu every time you launch Alpha, the menu
is saved in a cache file.  This is to speed up launching of Alpha as building
the filesets may take a while if there are many of them.  Therefore the
fileset submenus may become out of date and you have to rebuild them (indeed,
they may become out of date while you are using Alpha, in any case, if you add
or remove files from the relevant directories).  You can rebuild a single
fileset with either 'Update Current Fileset' or 'Update A Fileset…' and
rebuild them all with 'Rebuild All Filesets'.


	  	Current Fileset


Some functions that use filesets operate on the 'current' fileset.  The
current file set can be selected in the 'Choose' submenu of the Utilities
menu.  There is also a flag 'Auto Adjust Fileset' which will switch the
current fileset whenever the fileset menu is used to open a file.
	  	
	======================================================================


	  	Fileset Utilities Menu


There are various common fileset-related actions which you may wish to carry
out.  Some built-in actions are listed in the 'Fileset > Utilities' menu, and
others may be added by features you have activated.  The first half of the
menu contains the fundamental fileset operations, and the second half less
commonly used operations, including operations added by other features.

	Edit Filesets

Allows you to modify all details of all the filesets you have created.  It
also allows you to edit additional information which some packages might
attach to each fileset (for example, whether to use a version control system
for the files, or whether to use a particular tab size setting).

	Edit A Fileset

As above, but asks you to select a single fileset first.  It can be less
cumbersome to operate directly on a single fileset rather than through all of
them simultaneously.

	New Fileset          

Create a new fileset of one of the above six standard types (others may be
added by writing your own Tcl code, see below.)

	Delete Fileset

Remove a fileset, permanently if desired.

	Print Fileset

Print all files in a fileset

	Update Current Fileset

Re-build the current fileset from scratch

	Update A Fileset (hold down Option)

Lets you choose a fileset to rebuild.

	Rebuild All Filesets

Total menu rebuild, including all ftp filesets.

	Choose

A menu from which to set the current fileset.

	Hide Fileset

If you have many filesets, some of which are only used for searching purposes,
you can remove them from the menu.

	Fileset Flags

See the "# Fileset Preferences" section below for an explanation of the flags
that can be set.

	Find Tag

See the package: tags help window for more information.

	Create Tag File

See the package: tags help window for more information.


The items below may not all work for all types of filesets.

	Browse Fileset

Opens a browser window containing all fileset items, from which any can be
opened.

	Close Entire Fileset

Close all windows which belong to a given fileset.

	Fileset To Alpha

Convert all text files in a fileset to Alpha's creator.

	Open Entire Fileset

Open all the windows contained in the fileset for editing.

	Open Fileset Folder

Tells the Finder to open the base folder which contains a fileset.

	Rename Fileset

Change a fileset's name

	Replace In Fileset

Global search and replace in all files.  Use this item with care!

	Stuff Fileset

Use 'Drop Stuff' to compress all the files in the fileset.  For filesets which
are based on a directory hierarchy, you will be given the option of
compressing the entire hierarchy (as opposed to just the files listed in the
fileset).

	Word Count

Count all words in a fileset.


	  	Fileset Preferences


The following preferences can be changed at any time by selecting the
toggleable items in the "Fileset Menu > Utilities > Fileset Flags" menu:

	Auto Adjust Fileset

Opening a file from the menu will adjust current fileset

	Include Non Text Files

Files not of type 'TEXT' may be in the menu.

	Indent Fileset Items

Visually format submenus if appropriate.

	Sort Fileset Items

Force alphabetical ordering for all filesets

	Sort Filesets By Type

Structure the fileset menu in a user-defined, type- dependent fashion; see the
"# Personalization" section below.


	  	TeX filesets


The following items will be added to the utilities menu if you use TeX
filesets:

	Extract Eps BoxSizes

Search all document parts for included eps graphics, extract bounding box
information from the .eps files and insert it explicitly into the document
(can lead to much quicker typesetting).

	Delete Eps Box Sizes

Remove all the above bounding box information

	Hierarchical Bib Files

Bibliography files may \input others, so they should be searched (the default
is not to do this, because .bib files may be enormous).


	  	Binding keys to common fileset operations


Different users tend to use filesets in very different ways, so we cannot
create a useful common set of key bindings for the 'most common' fileset
operations.  If you wish to create a personalized key-binding for a particular
item in the utilities menu, then create a "prefs.tcl" file by selecting the
"Config > Preferences > Edit Prefs File" menu item, and add a line like the
following to that file:

	Bind 'o' <z> {filesetMenu::utilsProc "" openFilesetFolder…}

When you restart (or immediately if you 'evaluate' the line), your key-binding
will take effect.  The above will create a 'Control-O' keyboard shortcut to
the 'Open Fileset Folder' action.
	  	

	======================================================================


	  	Additional fileset information


Some packages may attach pieces of data to each fileset.  Examples could be
the default tab size to use for a fileset (useful if the files use a different
value to your own global default), or the type of version control under which
the files are registered.

Authors of Tcl extensions to Alpha use the proc: fileset::attachNewInformation
to add such data.  It automatically appears in the 'Edit Filesets' dialog.
The packages which currently attach such information, and/or provide
additional fileset functionality are as follows (list current only at the time
of writing):

	  	 	Recent files multi menu

If you use this more sophisticated version of the recent files menu, you will
find a new checkbox 'Use As Recent Files Group' by each fileset in the 'Edit'
dialogs.  If ticked for a fileset, then recently edited files from that
fileset are listed separately in the recent files menu.

	  	 	Fileset Tab Preference

If activated, you can select a default tab size to use for all files in a
given fileset.

	  	 	Fileset Indentation Preference

Similar to the tab preference, but, if activated, allows you to select tab
size, indentation amount, and 'indent using spaces only' settings for any
given fileset.

	  	 	Fileset Encoding Preference

Alphatk and Alpha 8 understand different types of textual encoding in which
files may be saved.  This feature allows you to specify a default encoding to
use for editing files in each fileset.

	  	 	Fileset Ftp Mirror

If you would like copies of all files in a fileset to be mirrored on a remote
ftp site, this feature allows you to attach information about the site (site
address, path, username and password) to a fileset, and then provides a new
menu item 'Update Fileset Mirror' in the fileset utilities menu which
automatically synchronizes the contents of the remote site with any changed
documents.


	  	Personalization


As well as adjusting the aforementioned flags, the fileset menu allows
complete user control of the structure of the menu (at least for users who
understand a little bit of Tcl) in the following way: Set the 'Sort Filesets
By Type' flag, and then set the Tcl variable "filesetSortOrder" as follows:

The structure of this variable dictates how the fileset menu is structured:
       
	'{pattern p}' 
    
Lists all filesets which match 'p'

	'-' 

Adds a separator line

	'{list of types}' 

Lists all filesets of those types.

	'{submenu name sub-order-list}' 
    
Adds a submenu with name 'name' and recursively adds filesets to that submenu
as given by the sub-order.
           
Leading, trailing and double separators are automatically removed.

For example, the default value of this variable (more as an example than
anything else) is:

	set filesetSortOrder { {pattern *Core} {pattern Packages} \
	  {pattern Menus} {pattern Modes} {pattern Preferences} \
	  - {tex} - {pattern *.cc} {submenu Headers {pattern *.h}} \
	  - {fromDirectory think codewarrior ftp \
	  fromOpenWindows fromHierarchy} * }

You can and should over-ride this in your global preferences file (copy and
paste from here into your "prefs.tcl" file, then make your changes).
