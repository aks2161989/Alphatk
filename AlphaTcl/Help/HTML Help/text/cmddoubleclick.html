<H1>Command-double-clicking</H1>

<P>
Command-double-clicking in an HTML window provides different kinds of 
functionality depending on where you click.
</P>

<H3>Command-double-clicking on an opening tag</H3>

<P>
Command-double-clicking on an opening tag lets you change the attributes of 
the tag. This is equivalent of using <A HREF="editing.html#edit"><SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Edit Tag</SPAN></A> 
in the <SPAN CLASS="menu">Editing</SPAN> 
menu. However, clicking on a color or URL attribute has a special 
effect, see below.
</P>

<H3>Command-double-clicking on a color attribute</H3>
<P>
Command-double-clicking on a color attribute brings up a color picker where 
you can change, and optionally name,  the color.
</P>

<H3>Command-double-clicking on a URL attribute</H3>

<P>
Command-double-clicking on an absolute URL sends the URL to your web 
browser.  This is not limited to HTML mode. It is a general feature of 
Alpha.
</P>

<P>
Command-double-clicking on a relative URL attribute opens a new window with 
the file if the file exists and is a text file.  If it does not exist, a 
dialog box appears as the one shown below.  As you see, a new empty window 
can be opened with the name of the file.  This window is automatically 
saved in the right place, and if necessary new folders are created.  Thus, 
if you are making a new set of pages, you can make links to the ones you 
have not written yet and then, by cmd-double-clicking, let Alpha make empty 
files which are saved where you want them.
</P>

<DIV>
<img src="../bilder/cmddoubleclick.png" alt="Cmd double click" width="374"
height="184">
</DIV>

<P>
Command-double-clicking on an anchor link &lt;A&nbsp;HREF="#anchor"&gt; jumps to 
the corresponding &lt;A&nbsp;NAME="anchor"&gt; in the file.
</P>

<P>
If the URL you click on points to a non-text file like an image, the file 
is opened in the application which created it. If you don't want to 
open non-text files this way you can disable this feature by unchecking 
<SPAN CLASS="item">Cmd-double-clicking on non-text file link opens file</SPAN> in the <A
HREF="prefs.html#General2">general preferences dialog</A>.
</P>

<H3>Command-double-clicking on a CSS URL</H3>

<P>
Command-double-clicking on a CSS URL property has the same effect as 
clicking on a URL attribute.
</P>

<H3>Command-double-clicking on an include tag</H3>
<P>
Command-double-clicking on an <A HREF="includes.html">include tag</A> opens 
the include file.
</P>

<H3>Command-double-clicking in home page windows</H3>

<P>
Command-double-clicking on a file or folder in a home page windows opens 
the file or a new home page window with the folder. Read more in the 
section about <A HREF="homepagewins.html">home page windows</A>.
