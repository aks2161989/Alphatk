<H1>Uploading files with FTP</H1>


<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/ftpmenu.png" ALT="FTP menu" WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="86"
CLASS="rightpic">
The <SPAN CLASS="menu">FTP</SPAN> menu contains functions for uploading your 
home page to an ftp server. In order to do so 
Alpha needs a helper application to do the uploading. Fetch, Interarchy, and 
NetFinder are the three ftp applications Alpha can talk to. <STRONG>Note!</STRONG> 
If you use NetFinder together with Alpha, NetFinder 2.1.2 or later is 
strongly recommended. 
</P>

<P>
In order to use HTML mode's ftp functions you must provide information 
about the ftp server of your home pages. See the page about <A 
HREF="config.html">configuring HTML mode</A>.
</P>


<div CLASS="item">Save to FTP Server</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
This is the basic function for uploading files. It first saves the current 
window to the disk and then uploads it to your ftp server.

<P>
If Alpha doesn't know your password you are asked for it. (The text box is 
made so narrow that it is impossible to see what you type.)
</P>

</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Forget Passwords</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
Makes Alpha forget all passwords, except those which you specified when you 
<A HREF="config.html">configured HTML mode</A>.
</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Upload Home Page...</div> 

<DIV CLASS="indent">
This function lets you 
intelligently upload all files in a home page folder by uploading only 
those which are locally modified.
This function works a little differently depending on which ftp application 
you use together with Alpha.

<P>
<B>Uploading with Interarchy</B>
</P>


<P>
This works in the same way as using the <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">FTP Mirror</SPAN> 
item in Interarchy's <SPAN CLASS="menu">File</SPAN> menu and choosing your 
home page folder as source folder. See Interarchy's documentation for 
details how the mirror upload works with Interarchy. Note that Interarchy 
deletes remote files not found locally.
</P>

<P>
<B>Uploading with Fetch</B>
</P>

<P>
Fetch does not have a built in mirror function and therefore uploading with 
Fetch is more primitive. You have to specify yourself which files to upload 
by telling it to upload those files which have been modified within a 
certain period of time. When using Fetch a dialog box is first opened asking 
you about this before the upload starts.
</P>

<P>
<B>Uploading with NetFinder</B>
</P>

<P>
This works in the same way as NetFinder's built in mirror functionality, 
but there are some technicalities you need to be aware of. NetFinder uses 
mirror lists to do the mirroring. Therefore Alpha needs to know which 
mirror list file to use when telling NetFinder to start uploading. There 
are two options:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>To each home page folder you can select a mirror list file which 
	contain a mirror item for this home page. <STRONG>Note!</STRONG> This 
	mirror list file may only contain one single item, because I have only 
	been able to make Alpha tell NetFinder to simultaneously mirror all items in a mirror list.
	<LI>You can let HTML mode create a mirror list file each time you upload. 
	This file contains the server, user name, password, and path, and otherwise 
	uses the default settings that NetFinder use when you create a new mirror 
	item.
</UL>

</DIV>

<div CLASS="item">NetFinder Mirror Files...</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
To select a mirror list file for a home page folder. If none is selected 
when you use <SPAN CLASS="item">Upload Home Page</SPAN> with NetFinder, you 
will be asked for one. You can choose to use a generic one, which 
means that Alpha creates a mirror file each time you want to upload, or 
select a mirror list file you have created in NetFinder.
