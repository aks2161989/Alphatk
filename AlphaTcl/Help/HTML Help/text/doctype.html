<H1>Document type declaration</H1>

<P>
A valid HTML or XHTML document has to include a document type declaration, which 
specifies which version of HTML or XHTML is used in the document. There is usually 
no harm in leaving it out as browsers ignores this information, but other 
tools such as validators often require a document type declaration. 
</P>

<P>
Alpha 
also uses the document type declaration to only let you use the HTML elements 
and attributes belonging to the HTML or XHTML version specified. If a document 
contains a document type declaration then Alpha does the following.
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The menu items for those elements not in the HTML or XHTML version specified 
	are disabled.
	<LI>The attributes not in the HTML or XHTML version specified are treated as if 
	they belonged to the category <SPAN CLASS="item">Never ask about</SPAN> 
	as discussed on the <A HREF="askedabout.html">previous page</A>. Thus 
	Alpha treats them as non-existing.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Note.</STRONG> Alpha understands the document type declarations
for HTML 4.0 and 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 and ignores all other ones.
</P>

<P>
The specification for HTML 4.0 was released 18 December 1997 and HTML 
4.01, which is a small update was released 24 December 1999. HTML 4.01 is the 
current [July 2003] official version of HTML. The specification for XHTML 
1.0 was released 26 january 2000, and the specification for XHTML 1.1 was 
released 31 May 2001. 
</p>

<P>
HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 both specifies three 
document type definitions (DTDs), which vary in the elements they support.
</P>

<DIV>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Strict</SPAN>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
Includes all elements and attributes that have not been deprecated (<A 
HREF="#deprecated">see below</A>) or do not appear in frameset documents. 
For HTML documents that use this DTD, use this document type declaration:</DIV>

<P CLASS="codeindent">
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
For XHTML documents that use this DTD, use this document type declaration:</DIV>

<P CLASS="codeindent">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"&gt;
</P>

<DIV>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Transitional</SPAN>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Includes everything in the strict DTD plus deprecated
elements and attributes (most of which concern visual presentation such as 
alignment and colors). For HTML documents that use this
DTD, use this document type declaration:
</DIV>

<P CLASS="codeindent">
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
For XHTML documents that use this DTD, use this document type declaration:</DIV>

<P CLASS="codeindent">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"&gt;
</P>

<DIV>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Frameset</SPAN>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
Includes everything in the transitional DTD plus frames as well. For HTML
documents that use this DTD, use this document type declaration:
</DIV>

<P CLASS="codeindent">
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"&gt;
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
For XHTML documents that use this DTD, use this document type declaration:</DIV>

<P CLASS="codeindent">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN"&gt;
</P>

<P CLASS="indent">
This document type declaration must be used and should only be used for 
documents defining the frames layout, i.e. documents containing FRAMESET and 
FRAME elements. For documents defining the content of the frames use either 
the strict or transitional DTD. If you want to use the attribute TARGET, 
then you have to use the transitional DTD.
</P>

<H3>XHTML 1.1</H3>

<P>
XHTML 1.1 is very similar to XHTML 1.0 Strict, but has been defined to be 
module-based. Its document type declaration is
</P>

<P CLASS="code">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"&gt;
</P>

<H3><A NAME="deprecated">Deprecated elements and attributes</A></H3>

<P>
Some elements and attributes are defined as deprecated in the HTML 4.01 and 
XHTML 1.0 specifications. A deprecated element or attribute is one that has been 
outdated by newer constructs such as style sheets. Deprecated elements may 
become obsolete in future versions of HTML.
</P>

<P>
The deprecated elements are APPLET, BASEFONT, CENTER, DIR, FONT, ISINDEX, 
MENU, S, STRIKE, and U. The deprecated attributes are mostly the ones which 
concerns presentation, such as alignment and colors.
</P>

<H3>Extensions to HTML 4.01</H3>

<P>
Alpha support some extensions to HTML 4.01 which were introduced by Netscape 
or Microsoft. For documents with a HTML 4.01 document type declaration these 
are obviously disabled. If you want to use extensions do not use a document 
type declaration in your documents. The elements which are extensions are 
MULTICOL, SPACER, NOBR, WBR, MARQUEE, BLINK, BGSOUND, EMBED, NOEMBED, 
KEYGEN, SERVER, LAYER, ILAYER, and NOLAYER.
</P>

<H3>Preferences related to DTDs</H3>

<DIV>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrsglobally.png" ALT="DTD related prefs" WIDTH="404"
HEIGHT="181">
</DIV>

<P>
In the global attribute preferences dialog you can specify two preferences 
which are related to the DTDs.
</P>

<DIV>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Don't use extensions to HTML 4.01</SPAN>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
HTML elements not included in HTML 4.01 will be disabled in the menu, and 
attributes not included in HTML 4.01 will not be asked about. Exactly the 
same set of elements and attributes are used as if the document had 
included a frameset document type declaration.
</DIV>


<DIV CLASS="itempara">Don't use deprecated elements and 
attributes</DIV>


<DIV CLASS="indent">Deprecated elements will be disabled in the menu and 
deprecated attributes will not be asked about (this includes the 
extensions). The set of elements and attributes and those in the strict DTD 
plus the ones used for frames. Use this setting when you are defining 
frames documents but don't want to use deprecated elements or 
attributes.</DIV>


<P>
When any of these two settings apply and there is also a document type 
declaration in the document, the largest set of elements and attributes 
allowed both by the settings and the DTD is used.
