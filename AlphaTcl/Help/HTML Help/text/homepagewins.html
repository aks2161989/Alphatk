Home page windows are windows with lists of files much in the same way as
Finder windows. The title of the window is the name of the folder. The first line in the 
window is the complete path to the folder. In the list of files the folders 
are shown in boldface.
</P>

<P>
The home page windows serve two purposes. They let you easily copy and 
paste to create HTML links and they let you open files without leaving 
Alpha or opening a file dialog.
</P>

You can navigate in the windows with the up and down arrows. You can also 
make quick jumps in the windows by relatively quickly type the first few 
letters of a file name. The selection then jumps to that file, just like in 
the Finder.
