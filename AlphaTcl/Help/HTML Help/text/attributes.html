<H1>Giving attributes to HTML elements</H1>

<P>
This page explains how you can give attributes to an HTML elements when you 
insert a new one using one of the menu items for an HTML element, or when 
you change an existing tag either using <A HREF="editing.html"><SPAN 
CLASS="menuitem">Edit Tag</SPAN></A> in the <SPAN 
CLASS="menu">Editing</SPAN> submenu of the HTML Utilities menu or <A 
HREF="cmddoubleclick.html">command-double-click</A> a tag. For other 
features which helps you modify an existing tag, see <A 
HREF="contextmenu.html">Contextual menu</A>, <A 
HREF="optionclick.html">Option-click in titlebar</A>, <A 
HREF="wordcompletion.html">Word completion</A>, and <A 
HREF="editing.html#insert"><SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Insert attributes</SPAN></A> in 
the <SPAN CLASS="menu">Editing</SPAN> menu.
</P>

<P>
When you insert a new HTML element using one of the menu items you can be 
asked about the element's attributes in two different 
ways: either in a dialog box with all attributes (the default), or in the 
status bar.  In the <A HREF="prefs.html">general preferences dialog</A> you 
can select which of these two ways you want to use. You can use different 
settings for when you give attributes to and insert a new tag and when you 
want to change an existing one.
</P>

<H2>Using dialog boxes</H2>

<P>
Different attributes can take different types of values, URLs, colors, 
integers, for example. Below we will go through how to specify the 
attribute value for the different kinds of attributes.
</P>

<DIV CLASS="item">
URL
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">

<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrURL.png" ALT="URL attribute" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="125">
</P>

<P>
You can specify the URL in three ways:
</P>

<OL>
	<LI>type the URL in the text box,
	<LI>choose one from the menu with your <A HREF="caches.html">URL cache</A>,
	<LI>select a file via a file dialog.  The file you have selected will 
	be put in the menu.
</OL>

<P>
<B>Note!</B> If you type a URL in the text box, it will be used even if you choose 
something from the menu.
</P>
<P>
It is probably much faster to type the URL than selecting a file from a 
file dialog, but the advantage of using the file dialog is that it will 
automatically insert a correct absolute or relative URL depending on which 
is appropriate.  If you use a BASE tag in the current window it will be 
noticed.
</P>

<P>
Alpha calculates the URL as follows. Files inside home page folders 
are mapped to a URL http://as.you.have.defined.it/file.html and files 
outside the home page folders are mapped to a URL file:///path/to/file.html
</P>

<P>
Alpha first determines the URL of the two files, and then determines the 
URL to link between them.
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>If you link within a home page folders you will get a relative URL.
	<LI>If you link between two different home page folders like 
	http://here.net/ and http://there.net/ you will get an absolute URL.
	<LI>If you link between two different home page folders like 
	http://www.net/~me/ and http://www.net/~you/ (at the same server), you 
	will get a relative URL.
</UL>

<P>
You can also make links between files which are not in a home page folder, 
but linking between files, where one is inside a home page folder and the 
other one is not, may not always make sense.
</P>

<P>
If you select a GIF, JPEG, or PNG file for the attribute SRC of IMG via a file 
dialog, the attributes WIDTH and HEIGHT are automatically determined.
</P>

</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Color
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrcolor.png" ALT="Color attribute" WIDTH="460"
HEIGHT="162">
</P>

<P>
You can specify the color in three ways:
</P>

<OL>
	<LI>type a hexadecimal number #RRBBGG, which defines the color, in the 
	text box,
	<LI>choose a color from the menu,
	<LI>define a new color.  The color so defined will be put in the menu.
</OL>

<P>
<B>Note!</B> If you type something in the text box, it will be used, even if you choose 
a color from the menu.
</P>

<P>
The menu contains first your own colors and then the 16 predefined colors 
in HTML. See the section <A HREF="colors.html">Color sets</A> about how to 
define your own colors and how to group them into sets.
</P>

</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Target window
</DIV>


<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrwindow.png" ALT="Target window attribute" WIDTH="460"
HEIGHT="165">
</P>

<P>
You can specify the target window in two ways:
</P>

<OL>
	<LI>type the window name in the text box,
	<LI>choose a window name from the menu with your <A HREF="caches.html">window cache</A>.
</OL>

<P>
<B>Note!</B> If you type something in the text box, it will be used, even if you choose 
a window from the menu.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Content type
</DIV>


<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrcontenttype.png" ALT="Content type attribute"
WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="98">
</P>

<P>
You can specify the content type in two ways:
</P>

<OL>
	<LI>type the content type in the text box,
	<LI>choose one from the menu.
</OL>

<P>
<B>Note!</B> If you type something in the text box, it will be used, even if you choose 
something from the menu.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Media descriptors, Content types, Link types
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrmedia.png" ALT="Content types attribute" WIDTH="460"
HEIGHT="50">
</P>

<P>
These are attributes which takes a list of values. Media descriptors and 
content types should be a comma separated list, while the link types 
should be space separated. You can either type the value you want directly 
into the text box, or select values from the menu. Clicking the Add button 
will add the selected item to the text box. <B>Note!</B> If there is 
something selected in the menu when you leave the dialog, it will 
automatically be added to the attribute value. Thus if you only need one 
value, it is enough to select it in the menu without having to click Add.
</P>

<P>
The values in the menu can be edited by using the functions <SPAN 
CLASS="menuitem">Content types</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Media 
descriptors</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Link types</SPAN> in the 
<A HREF="prefs.html#types"><SPAN CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN></A> menu.
</P>

</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Predefined choices
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrchoices.png" ALT="Choices attribute" WIDTH="260"
HEIGHT="118">
</P>

<P>
Attributes which take a value from a predefined list of choices. Select a 
value from the menu.
</P>

</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Integer, Length, Multilength
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrnumber.png" ALT="Number attribute" WIDTH="180"
HEIGHT="31">
</P>

<P>
Attributes which take an numerical value.  The number will be checked that 
it is in the valid range and that it is of the right type, e.g. if a 
percentage value is allowed.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Flag
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrflag.png" ALT="Flag attribute" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="23">
</P>

<P>
These are attributes which does not take any value.  Check the checkbox to 
use it.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="item">
Date and time
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrtime.png" ALT="Date and time attribute" WIDTH="460"
HEIGHT="52">
</P>

<P>
These are attributes which takes a date and time of ISO format as its 
value. Either specify the value or check <B>Current time</B> to have Alpha 
insert the value of the current time.
</P>
</DIV>

<P>
If an element has very many attributes, the dialog box may have to be 
divided into two, or possibly three, pages to fit your screen.  Then there 
will be a menu in the upper left corner of the dialog box to switch between 
the pages.  The dialog box is made as large as possible before being split 
into two or three pages.
</P>

<P>
Alpha will complain if you forget a required attribute, and in most cases 
it will complain if you give a value to an attribute which is not valid.
</P>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrpages.png" ALT="Divided attribute dialog" WIDTH="430"
HEIGHT="193">
</P>

<H2>Using the status bar</H2>

<P>
When you use the status bar, Alpha will go through the attributes and ask 
you to type a value for each of them in the status bar. It you do not want 
to give a value to an attribute, simply type return and the attribute is 
skipped. You can customize which attributes to be asked about, see the next 
page.
</P>

<P>
By default, Alpha beeps for the first attribute 
it asks you about in order to attract your attention.  You can turn off the 
beep in the <A HREF="prefs.html">general preferences 
dialog</A>.
</P>

<P>
For each attribute you will get a prompt in the status bar. When an 
attribute is optional, "(optional)" is added to the prompt. When you are 
editing an already existing tag, the current value will be given as a 
default within brackets. This value will be used if you do not specify a new value. 
</P>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/bar1.png" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="15" ALT="Status bar, required element"><BR>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/bar3.png" WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="15" ALT="Status bar, optional element"><BR>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrstatusdefault.png" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="15" ALT="Default value">
</P>

<P>
You can simply type the value you want for an attribute, but some keys have 
special functions to speed up your work.
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">tab</SPAN> - If you type tab Alpha will look at what you 
have typed so far and match it against the possible options and attempt to 
complete it as much as possible. If Alpha cannot complete anything it will 
beep. Let us illustrate this with an example. If you are asked about the 
value for the attribute ALIGN of the P element, the possible values are 
LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, and JUSTIFY. If you now type C and then tab, Alpha 
will complete this for you by adding ENTER giving the value CENTER.
</P>

<P>
Tab can be used for the following types of attributes:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Predefined choices</SPAN> Alpha attempts to 
	match against the list of predefined choices.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">URL</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match against your 
	your URL cache.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Target window</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against your window cache.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Color</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match against the 
	list of color names.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Content type(s)</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against the list of content types. If you type a list of content types 
	Alpha will attempt to complete the one after the last comma.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Media descriptors</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against the list of media descriptors. If you type a list of media 
	descriptors Alpha will attempt to complete the one after the last 
	comma.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Link types</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against the list of link types. If you type a list of link types 
	Alpha will attempt to complete the one after the last space.
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">double tab</SPAN> - As just explained, when you type tab 
Alpha will try to complete what you have typed as much as possible. 
Sometimes there are several possible options and Alpha can only 
complete partially. Then if you immediately type a second tab Alpha will 
open a window with a list of everything that match what you have typed so 
far. If you choose something from the list, Alpha will use that value 
and immediately jump to ask you about the next attribute.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">ctrl-f</SPAN> - Ctrl-f can be used for attributes of the 
types <SPAN CLASS="item">URL</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="item">Color</SPAN>. If 
you are asked for a URL, typing ctrl-f will let you select a file from a 
file dialog. If you are asked for a color, typing ctrl-f will let you 
define a new color from a color picker.  Once you have selected a file or 
defined a new color, Alpha immediately jumps to ask you about the next 
attribute.
</P>

<P>
If you select a GIF, JPEG, or PNG file for the attribute SRC of IMG via a file 
dialog, the attributes WIDTH and HEIGHT are automatically determined.  Just 
hit return for the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes and the automatically 
determined values will be used.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">cmd-v</SPAN> - Pastes the clipboard into the 
status bar.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">ctrl-q</SPAN> - Skips the current and 
subsequent attributes.  This saves you from going through the whole list of 
attributes.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">ctrl-d</SPAN> - Sometimes there is a default 
value for an attribute. In particular when you are changing an existing 
tag the current value is given as default. This default value is given 
within brackets in the prompt:
</P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrstatusdefault.png" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="15" ALT="Default value">

<P>
If you type a new value it will be used and if you just hit return without 
giving a value, the default one will be used. In this case, if you do not 
want any value at all and want to remove this attribute, type ctrl-d to 
skip this attribute.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">escape</SPAN> - Deletes everything written.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">ctrl-z</SPAN> - Cancel everything.
</P>
</DIV>

<H3>Other things to note</H3>

<P>
When you are asked about a <SPAN CLASS="item">Color</SPAN> attribute, you 
can either type a color value #123456 or the name of one of your colors.
</P>

<P>
When you are asked about a <SPAN CLASS="item">Date and time</SPAN> 
attribute you can type "now" to make Alpha use the current time as the 
value.
