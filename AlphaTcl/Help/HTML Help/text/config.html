<H1>Configuring HTML mode</H1>

<P>
There are several functions in HTML mode for maintaining one or more www 
sites.  To be able to use these functions in the best way you have to tell 
Alpha which folder contains the files of a www site.  To do this use <SPAN 
CLASS="menuitem">Home pages</SPAN> in the <SPAN 
CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN> submenu of the HTML menu.  The idea is that each of those 
folders, together with their subfolders, should contain all your html files 
at a server and be a mirror of your home page at the corresponding server.
</P>

<P>
When you select <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Home Pages</SPAN> from the <SPAN 
CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN> menu you are presented with a dialog 
window which looks like the one above. (This is actually what it looks like 
after you have given some information. At first a few things are absent.) 
In this window you have the following:
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">URLs:</SPAN> a menu with all home pages you 
have a folder for on your disk. The rest of the things are information 
related to this home page and are described in detail below.
</P>

</DIV>

<P>
At the bottom there are a couple buttons:
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">New:</SPAN> To define a new home page folder. You are 
presented with a second dialog as shown below.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Change:</SPAN> To change the home page selected in 
the menu.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Remove:</SPAN> To remove the home page selected in 
the menu.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Tell Big Brother:</SPAN> If you check this check box, 
the URL mappings will be changed in Big Brother's settings, when you click 
OK. Big Brother is told which home page folders map to which URLs.  Big 
Brother is a shareware program for checking links by Fran&ccedil;ois 
Pottier, Francois.Pottier@inria.fr.  You can get Big Brother from <A 
HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/" TARGET="_top">his home page</A>. Read more 
about how to use Big Brother together with Alpha in the section <A
HREF="checklinks.html">Checking Links</A>.
</P>
</DIV>

<P>
<img src="../bilder/homepages2.png" alt="Home page dialog" width="474"
height="416">
</P>

<P>
In the second dialog which appears when you click 'New' or 'Change' you 
can specify:
</P>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Home Page Folder:</SPAN> The folder containing all 
the files of your home page.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Include Folder:</SPAN> A folder where you can put your 
files to be dynamically included.  To define an include folder is 
optional and only needed if you want to use dynamically included files. 
Read about dynamically included files in the section <A 
HREF="includes.html">Include files</A>.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Template folder:</SPAN> A folder with templates to use 
when creating new HTML documents. To define a template folder is optional. 
Read about how to use templates in the section <A 
HREF="newdocs.html">Creating a new document</A>.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">URL:</SPAN> The URL to your home page, for 
example<BR>
http://www.theophys.kth.se/~jl/
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Default file:</SPAN> The file which is used if a link 
points to a directory.  This name depends on the configuration of your 
server, but is often index.html.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Ftp Server:</SPAN> The ftp server which you upload
your files to. If you specify one you can upload your files using the 
submenu <A HREF="ftp.html"><SPAN CLASS="menu">FTP</SPAN></A> in the HTML Utilities menu.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">User ID:</SPAN> The name of your account on the 
machine you upload files to.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Password:</SPAN> Your password. Unfortunately 
Alpha doesn't support textboxes where bullets are inserted, so the password 
has to be given in a separate dialog where the textbox is made no narrow it 
is impossible to see what you type, see below. Click the 'Set...' button to 
set your password. <B>Note!</B> Only specify your password here if it's 
safe to do so. Alpha saves the password in <B>plain text</B> in its 
preference file. If you don't specify it here you can give it when you want 
to upload a file.
</P>

height="114">

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Directory:</SPAN> The directory of your home page 
relative to your home directory.
</P>
</DIV>

<P>
The minimum information you need to provide is the <B>home page folder</B>, 
<B>server URL</B>, and <B>default file</B>. Everything else is optional.
