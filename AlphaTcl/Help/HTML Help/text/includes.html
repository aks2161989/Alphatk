The <SPAN CLASS="menu">Includes</SPAN> menu contains functions to 
dynamically include files in your document.  Let's say you have a document 
where one part contains information which is updated frequently while the 
rest is almost never changed.  You can let the part which changes often be 
in another file and insert 'include tags' in the original document.  As 
another example, let's say some information is used in more than one 
document, perhaps if you make two versions of your home page, one with 
frames and one without.  You can then have this information in a separate 
file and and insert 'include tags' in the other ones.  In this way you only 
have to make a change at one place.  You can later quickly update your 
files and replace the text between the 'include tags'.
</P>

<P>
Exactly how the include tags look like is explained below, but an example is
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- #INCLUDE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">INCLPATH=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"myfile.html"</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="commentcode">--&gt;</SPAN>
content of myfile.html will go here
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- /#INCLUDE --&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>
When you define a <A HREF="config.html">home page folder</A>, you can also 
define an include folder for it, where you can put all the 'include files'.  
Although you can put the include files anywhere you like, the include 
folder has certain advantages when the include files contain links.  When 
Alpha inserts the include file it automatically builds the relative links 
for you.  To see what I mean, consider the following example:
</P>


<UL>
<LI>Suppose you have a home page folder for http://www.net/ 
and have defined a corresponding include folder.
<LI>Open a new file 'include.html' in the include folder.
<LI>Make a couple of links from include.html.  Use the file 
dialog and select files in the home page folder.  The links will now be 
like HREF=":HOMEPAGE:somefile.html".
<LI>Now open a new file hi.html in the home page folder.  Use 'Insert include 
tags' and select the file include.html in the include 
folder.  The part :HOMEPAGE: in the links will now be replaced by the 
correct relative path to somefile.html.
</UL>

<P>
This feature lets you include the same file in many files in different 
places in the folder hierarchy, without having to worry about that the 
links are correct. Alpha takes care of that for you.
</P>

<P>
Recursive including of files is possible. You can include another file 
in include.html, which in turn includes another file, which includes
another file...
</P>

<P>
A few of other things:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>If you check links in include.html Alpha will look for 
files in the home page folder.
<LI>If you cmd-double-click a link in include.html, Alpha 
will open the file in your home page folder.
</UL>

<H2>Using place holders</H2>

<P>
The include file can contain place holders for arbitrary text - and even 
scripts - which is defined by attributes of the include tags. Let us 
illustrate this with an example, where we have an include file myfile.html 
with the content:
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
My name is ##NAME##. 
</PRE>

<P>
##NAME## is the place holder and will be replaced when the file is included 
in another document. A place holder begins and ends with ## and the text in 
between is the attribute name which will be used in the include tag. The 
name is case insensitive.
</P>

<P>
An example of include tags which uses this include file is:
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- #INCLUDE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">INCLPATH=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"myfile.html"</SPAN> NAME=<SPAN CLASS="textcode">"Johan"</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="commentcode">--&gt;</SPAN>
My name is Johan.
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- /#INCLUDE --&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>
In this example the place holder ##NAME## was replaced by a text string. It 
is also possible to use Tcl scripts. Even if you do not know Tcl or do not plan 
to use scripts in the include tags there is still one technical detail you must be 
aware of. In order for Alpha to be able to always interpret your text string 
as text and not as a script, some characters have to be preceded by a \ 
character. These are $, [, ], and \. To illustrate this consider a case 
where the place holder ##NAME## should be replaced by "J$h[a]n\s". Then the 
NAME attribute must be
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
NAME=<SPAN CLASS="textcode">"J\$h\[a\]n\\s"</SPAN>
</PRE>

<H3>Using scripts</H3>

<P>
As mentioned above you can also use scripts as attribute values for the 
place holders. In fact, the attribute value can be a combination of text 
and scripts. What Alpha does is to take the attribute value and apply the 
command <SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">subst</SPAN> to it. Subst does variable, 
command, and backslash substitution of its argument. To illustrate how subst 
works let us say you have defined a variable myname by
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">set</SPAN> myname Johan
</PRE>

<P>
and a Tcl proc myproc by
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">proc</SPAN> myproc {} {
    <SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">return</SPAN> Johan
}
</PRE>

<P>
then
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">subst</SPAN> $myname
</PRE>

<P>
returns "Johan" which also
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code"><SPAN 
CLASS="htmlcode">subst</SPAN> [myproc]
</PRE>

<P>
does. 
</P>

<P>
You can combine text, variables, and commands in any way you like in the 
attribute value like in this example:
</P>
<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- #INCLUDE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">INCLPATH=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"myfile.html"</SPAN> NAME=<SPAN CLASS="textcode">"$myname and he is another [myproc]"</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="commentcode">--&gt;</SPAN>
My name is Johan and he is another Johan.
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- /#INCLUDE --&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>

<div CLASS="item">Insert Include Tags...</div>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Asks you for a 
file to include, and inserts two tags inside comments. These tags look a 
little different depending on where the included file is relative to the 
current document. (<STRONG>Note!</STRONG> In previous versions of HTML 
mode, these tags were slightly different. The old format is still 
supported.) We begin with the case where there are no place holders.

<P>
Included file is in the include folder:
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- #INCLUDE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">INCLPATH=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"path to file relative to include folder"</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="commentcode">--&gt;</SPAN>
content of file
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- /#INCLUDE --&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>
Included file is somewhere else on the same disk.
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- #INCLUDE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">PATH=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"relative path to file"</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="commentcode">--&gt;</SPAN>
content of file
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- /#INCLUDE --&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>
Included file is on another disk.
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- #INCLUDE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">FILE=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"path to file"</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="commentcode">--&gt;</SPAN>
content of file
<SPAN CLASS="commentcode">&lt;!-- /#INCLUDE --&gt;</SPAN>
</PRE>

<P>
Depending on your <A HREF="prefs.html#General2">preferences</A>, the content of the 
file may not be inserted until you update the window.
</P>

<P>
If the path contains any of the characters &lt;"&gt;#,
they are translated like <BR>
<SPAN CLASS="code"># -&gt; #; <BR>
&lt; -&gt; #lt;<BR>
&gt; -&gt; #gt;<BR>
" -&gt; #qt;<BR></SPAN>
in order to make the tag unambiguous.
</P>
</DIV>
<H3>Inserting include files with place holders</H3>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
When using <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Insert Include Tags...</SPAN> to include 
files with place holders, Alpha scans the file to include and opens a dialog 
box where you can specify the values of the place holders.
</P>

<P>
<img src="../bilder/placeholder.png" alt="Place holder dialog" width="524"
height="146">
</P>

<P>
The include tags with the attributes for the place holders are then 
inserted.
</P>

</DIV>


<H3>Updating the files</H3>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
<P>
If you change the content of the included file, you can quickly 
update your documents with the update functions below.
</P>
</DIV>

<div CLASS="item">Update Window</div>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Replaces the text 
between all pairs of 'include tags' with the content of the file specified 
in the opening tags.</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Update Home Page</div>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Replaces the text 
between all pairs of 'include tags' in HTML files in a home page folder with 
the content of the file specified in the opening tags.</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Update Folder</div>
<DIV CLASS="indent">The same function for a 
folder.</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Update File</div>
<DIV CLASS="indent">The same function for a 
single file.
</DIV>

<H3>Note!</H3>

<P>
If you write anything between the 'include tags', it is only a temporary 
change.  The next time you update your document everything between the tags 
is replaced.
</P>

<P>
If you remove 'include tags' in a document, make sure you remove both the 
opening tag and the corresponding closing tag.
</P>

<P>
If a file contains 'last modified date' tags, the date is changed if the 
file has been modified.
</P>
