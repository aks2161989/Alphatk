<H1>Extending HTML mode</H1>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/extendmenu.png" ALT="Extend menu" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="67"
CLASS="rightpic">
You can add new HTML elements, or new attributes to existing elements, to 
HTML mode. New elements will be put in a new submenu <SPAN 
CLASS="menu">Custom</SPAN> of the HTML menu. The possibility to extend HTML 
mode was originally developed when HTML was continuously evolving with 
Netscape and Microsoft adding new extensions to HTML. It provided a way for 
you to add these new elements before HTML mode was updated. Now when HTML 
has stabilized the main reason for the extendability is for the user to be able 
to add elements of scripting languages, which use tags which look like HTML 
tags.
</P>

<P>
Your custom elements will always be available, regardless of the document 
type declaration in the document or the attribute preferences. It is 
assumed that you add new element because you want to use them... However, 
when validating the document all custom elements are considered as unknown.
</P>

<P>
The <SPAN CLASS="menu">Extend</SPAN> menu has three functions:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">New Element</SPAN> to add a new element
	<LI><SPAN 
	CLASS="item">Edit Element</SPAN> to add new attributes to an existing HTML 
	element, or one you have previously added.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Remove Additions</SPAN> to delete a new element or 
	to remove the new attributes you have added to an existing element.
</UL>

<H2>Adding a new element</H2>

<DIV>
<img src="../bilder/newelement.png" alt="New element" width="364" height="246">
</DIV>

<P>
When adding a new element a dialog box is first opened where you can 
specify:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The name of the element.
	<LI>If the element has a closing tag or not. (Applies only if the type below 
	is "Normal".)
	<LI>The type of the element. There are three available types:
	
	<UL>
		<LI>Normal. This is the option you would normally use. 
		<LI>A new type of INPUT element. This option is here for technical and 
		historical reasons. In the <SPAN CLASS="menu">Forms</SPAN> menu the INPUT 
		element is available for each value of the TYPE attribute. This because 
		the other attributes vary depending on the value of the TYPE attribute. 
		Here you can add another variant of the INPUT element, and in this case 
		you give the value of the TYPE attribute as the element name. 
		<LI>A plug-in using EMBED. Most plug-ins have their own specific 
		attributes. Here you add a new EMBED element with all these attributes. 
		By default all attributes of the generic EMBED element are added.
	</UL>
	
</UL>

<P>
Next you are asked to give a key binding for the new element. This dialog 
box is the same as is used when <A HREF="keybindings.html">changing key bindings in the menus</A>.
</P>

<P>
Thereafter you are asked to specify the layout for the element. This is 
done in the way explained in the section about <A HREF="layout.html">element layout</A>.
</P>

<P>
Next a window is opened where you can specify the attributes. This is 
explained in the next subsection.
</P>

<H2>Editing an element</H2>

<P>
When you are adding a new element or editing an existing one a window is 
opened where you can specify the attributes. <STRONG>Note!</STRONG> You 
should <STRONG>not</STRONG> edit the text in this window directly, but only 
through dialog boxes and the key shortcuts described below. Direct editing 
has <STRONG>no</STRONG> effect, except possibly messing things up. There is 
a reason that this window is made read-only.
</P>

<P>
<img src="../bilder/editelement.png" alt="Edit element" width="297"
height="391">
</P>

<P>
Above is the edit window for the IMG element, where we have already 
added a new attribute MYATTRIBUTE. Each attribute is given in this window 
like this: 
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>First we have the attribute name - a bullet to the left of the name indicates that it is 
	provided by HTML mode and cannot be edited.
	<LI>Then comes the attribute type.
	<LI>The text "required" indicates that the attribute is required.
	<LI>For attributes of the type "Choices" all available choices are listed 
	below.
	<LI>For attributes taking numerical values the minimum and maximum allowed 
	value is given below.
</UL>

<H2>Adding a new attribute</H2>

where you can specify:

	<LI>The attribute type.
	<LI>If the attribute is required.
</UL>

<P>
The available types are:
</P>

<P>
A few attribute types require additional information.
</P>

<P>
For attributes of the type <SPAN CLASS="item">Choices</SPAN> you must 
specify all valid choices in a second dialog box.  The choices you define 
will be displayed in the dialog window as you go along, as shown below. 
Click
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>'OK' for each choice
	<LI>'No more choices' <B>after</B> you have clicked OK for the last 
	one.
	<LI>'Remove last' to remove the last choice you just defined.  You can 
	remove them all one after another to correct a mistake somewhere.
</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="item">Integer</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="item">Multi length</SPAN>,

<H2>Editing and deleting attributes</H2>

<P>
To edit an attribute to change its name, type, and values, browse to the 
attribute and hit <SPAN CLASS="item">return</SPAN>. You can then give it values in the same way as 
when you define a new attribute as described above. <STRONG>Note</STRONG> 
that attributes marked with a bullet cannot be modified with one exception. 
You can add new choices to an attribute of type <SPAN 
CLASS="item">Choices</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="item">Cmd-double-clicking</SPAN> 
on an attribute also lets you edit it.
</P>

<P>
To delete an attribute browse to the attribute and type <SPAN 
CLASS="item">delete</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="item">backspace</SPAN>. You can 
also select several lines and delete them all at once. <STRONG>Note</STRONG> 
that attributes marked with a bullet cannot be deleted.
</P>

<H2>Saving</H2>

<P>
Once you are finished close the window to save your changes. To <SPAN
CLASS="item">cancel</SPAN> the changes hold down the shift key while 
clicking the window's close box.
