<H1>Checking links</H1>


<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/checklinks.png" ALT="Check Links menu" WIDTH="180"
HEIGHT="136" CLASS="rightpic">
The <SPAN CLASS="menu">Check Links</SPAN> menu contains functions to scan 
files and check that all links, HREFs, SRCs etc. as well as CSS links 
url("...")  point to files which exist.  The files which are scanned are 
the HTML and CSS files.  For this to be useful the files in your 
home page folders must be mirrors of the files at your servers.  If you use 
this function as intended you never have to worry about dead links between 
your files anymore.
</P>

<P>
It works as follows: In every file scanned Alpha looks for all link 
attributes: HREFs, SRCs, etc in the file.  If you use the BASE element it 
will be noticed and used to determine to which URL a link is pointing. 
Everything inside comments is ignored.
</P>

<P>
For each link Alpha first determines where it is pointing. Links to remote 
servers, which you do not have a home page folder for, are ignored.  Also, 
if you have a home page folder for http://www.net/~myplace/, links like 
http://www.net/file.html are ignored, as they are outside your home page.  
For all other links, Alpha checks if the file exist.
</P>

<P>
If any invalid links are found, a 
window is opened where the lines look as follows:
</P>

	
<PRE CLASS="code">
file.html                Line 8:   HREF="otherfile.html"
file2.html               Line 23:  (anchor missing) HREF="file.html#anchor"
folder:file3.html        Line 17:  (BASE used) SRC="pic/coolpic.gif"
</PRE>

	

<P>
In the first column is the name of the file with the link, 
including the path relative to the home page folder.  In 
the second column is the line number where the invalid link 
is, and in the third column is the link itself.
(anchor missing) means that the file exists but that the anchor
is missing in the file. 
(BASE used) means that the file contains a BASE element.  
Use the up and down arrows to select a line in this window, 
and carriage return to open the file and select the line 
with the invalid link.
</P>

<P>
You can optionally check that the case of the links match the case of the 
file names on your disk.  This can be useful as Mac file names are not case 
sensitive, while for example unix file names are.  Therefore a link can 
work on your Mac but not work on a unix machine. Checking the case makes 
link checking slower and is therefore not done by default. See below how to 
enable case sensitive link checking.
</P>

<H2>Fixing a broken link</H2>

<P>
You can fix broken links by selecting a new one. To do this
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Browse to the line with the link you want to fix in the window with 
	invalid links.
	<LI>Hit <SPAN CLASS="item">option-return</SPAN>. You can now select a 
	new file from a file dialog.
	<LI>The link is now changed in your HTML document and the link is 
	removed from the list of invalid links.
</UL>

<P>
When the broken link contains an anchor "file.html#anchor", Alpha checks if 
the new file contains that anchor. If it does, #anchor is added to the new 
link, otherwise not.
</P>

<P>
Fixing a link works as long as you do not make any other changes to the 
file first. Then Alpha may not find the line with the broken link.
</P>

<H2>Checking links with Big Brother</H2>

<P>
Big Brother is a shareware program by Fran&ccedil;ois Pottier, 
Francois.Pottier@inria.fr.  You can get Big Brother from his <A 
HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/" TARGET="_top">home page</A>.
</P>

<P>
The big advantage with Big Brother is that it can check all your remote 
links.  It checks local links on your hard disk with about the same speed 
as Alpha, but Big Brother can run in the background while you do other 
things. Differences between Alpha and Big Brother are
</P> 

<UL>
	<LI>Big Brother understands all HTML 3.2 links, but not things like 
	&lt;FRAME SRC="url"&gt;
	<LI>Big Brother does not check anchors.
	<LI>Big Brother does not check CSS links.
</UL>


<div CLASS="item">Check Remote Links</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
To check remote links in the current window using Big Brother. Big Brother 
1.2 or later is required to use this function. A list of all remote links 
in the current window is sent to Big Brother. Big Brother checks the links 
and sends the result back to Alpha, which displays the result in a window. 
If a page has moved to a new location the link in your HTML window is 
automatically updated. Don't make any other changes to the file while 
checking remote links, because then Alpha may not find the line with the 
link to update.
</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Use Big Brother</div>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Marking this menu item 
to indicates that link checks will be done with Big Brother instead of 
Alpha.  If this menu item is checked, files and folders will be sent to Big 
Brother when you check links.


<P>
Some settings are temporarily changed in Big 
Brother, when you send a file or folder to it. These are
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The URL mapping of your home page folders.
<LI>If subfolders should be searched or not.
<LI>If case sensitive link checking should be done.
<LI>Optionally you can tell Big Brother if it should 
ignore remote or local links.  By default Big Brother's settings 
for this are used.
</UL>

</DIV>

<H2>Link checking preferences</H2>

<P>
You can set some preferences for how to check links in the dialog box <SPAN
CLASS="menuitem">Check Links...</SPAN> in the <SPAN 
CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN> menu.

<div CLASS="item">Check anchors</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
When checked, 'Check links' will check that there is an anchor &lt;A 
NAME="anchor"&gt; in file.html if a link &lt;A HREF="file.html#anchor"&gt; 
points to it. By default anchors are checked.
</DIV>


<div CLASS="itempara">Case sensitive checking (slower)</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
When checked, 'Check Links' will check that the case in the links match the 
case in the file and folder names. This can be useful as Mac file names are 
not case sensitive, while for example unix file names are. Case sensitive 
checking is slower, and therefore not done by default. If you send the 
files to Big Brother, Big Brother also uses this setting to decide if case 
sensitive checking should be made.
</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Bring Big Brother to front when checking 
links</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
If you use Big Brother to check links, this will determine if Big Brother 
stays in the background or not, when you send files to it. By default Big 
Brother is brought to the front.
</DIV>

<div CLASS="itempara">Use Big Brother's link check 
options</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
When not checked, the settings for the two links checking options below 
will used instead of the corresponding options in Big Brother. By default 
Big Brother's settings are used.
</DIV>


<div CLASS="itempara">Ignore remote links</div>

<DIV CLASS="indent">
The same as the corresponding option in Big Brother.

<div CLASS="itempara">Ignore local links</div>
