<H1>Moving and renaming files and folders</H1>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/moving.png" ALT="Moving" WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="78"
CLASS="rightpic"> In the HTML Utilities menu there are three functions to move 
and rename files and folders and automatically update all links in the 
files.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Move Files...</SPAN> lets you move a set of files from 
one folder to another within a home page folder or within an include 
folder. 
</P>

<P>
When moving files you are
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>First asked to select the folder which contains the files 
	you want to move.
	<LI>Then you are asked to select the files you want to move from this 
	folder.
	<LI>And finally you are asked to select the destination folder.
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Rename File...</SPAN> lets you rename and move a single 
file within a home page folder or within an include 
folder.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Rename Folder...</SPAN> lets you rename and move a 
folder within a home page folder or within an include folder.
</P>

<P>
When renaming a file or folder you are 
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>First asked to select the file or folder to rename and move.
	<LI>Then you are asked to select a new name and its destination folder.
</UL>

<P>
Alpha then makes the move and then asks you if you want to update all 
links (this is the whole point of this function, so a 'yes' should be 
appropriate, but it gives you a chance to abort the update if you have 
moved the wrong files).
</P>

<P>
Alpha now updates all HTML links, HREF, SRC, etc. as well as CSS links 
url("...") and all include links &lt;!-- #INCLUDE ... --&gt; to make sure 
that they point at the same files as before. This update is done in all 
files both in the home page folder and the include folder.
</P>

<P>
Updating links may take a little while if you have very many files but 
should in most cases be a lot faster than to make the changes manually.
