<H1>Deciding which attributes to be asked about</H1>

<P>
Most HTML elements have very many attributes. Therefore you can select which 
attributes to be asked about. This to reduce the cluttering of the dialog 
boxes or to reduce the number of attributes to be asked about in the 
status bar.
</P>

<P>
There are several things which determine which attributes you are asked 
about.
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The document type declaration in the file, if there is one. 
	Alpha recognizes HTML 4.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1 document type declarations.
	<LI>Preferences set using the menu item <SPAN 
	CLASS="menuitem">Attributes Globally</SPAN> in the <SPAN 
	CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN> submenu of the HTML menu.
	<LI>Individual settings for each HTML element using the menu item <SPAN 
	CLASS="menuitem">Use Attributes</SPAN> in the <SPAN 
	CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN> submenu of the HTML menu.
</UL>

<P>
The effect of the document type declaration will be discussed on the <A 
HREF="doctype.html">next page</A>. Here we will discuss the global and the 
individual settings for the attributes.
</P>

<H2>Individual settings</H2>

<P>
You select which attributes to be asked about for a certain HTML element 
using the menu item <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Use Attributes</SPAN> in the <SPAN 
CLASS="menu">Preferences</SPAN> submenu of the HTML menu. First you choose from a list 
which element you want to change the settings for.  In 
this list 'LI IN UL' and 'LI IN OL' are the LI element for UL and OL lists 
respectively. 'INPUT TYPE=xxx' is the INPUT element with the type xxx. 
</P>

<P>
For each attribute you can specify one of the following:
</P>

<DIV>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/useattrs.png" ALT="Use attributes" WIDTH="370" HEIGHT="78">
</DIV>


<DIV>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Always ask about</SPAN>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Attributes you always want to be asked about. They 
always appear in the attribute dialog box or are always prompted for in the 
status bar.</DIV>
</DIV>


<DIV CLASS="itempara">Don't ask about at first</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Attributes you don't use so often but still want to be 
able to be asked about.</DIV>


<DIV CLASS="indent">

<P>
If you use dialog boxes the dialog box will first only contain the 
attributes which you have told Alpha to <SPAN CLASS="item">Always ask 
about</SPAN>. Then there will be a button <B>More...</B> in the dialog box. 
Clicking this button will open a new larger dialog box which includes the 
attributes for which you have told Alpha: <SPAN CLASS="item">Don't ask 
about at first</SPAN>.
</P>

<P>
If you use the status bar you are first asked about the attributes you have 
told Alpha to <SPAN CLASS="item">Always ask about</SPAN>. Then you are 
asked about the attributes you for which you have told Alpha: <SPAN 
CLASS="item">Don't ask about at first</SPAN>. In this way you will be asked 
about the attributes you use most first. Remember that you can always skip 
all the subsequent attributes with <SPAN CLASS="item">ctrl-q</SPAN>.
</P>

</DIV>

<DIV>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Never ask about</SPAN>
<DIV CLASS="indent">Attributes you never want to be asked about. They 
never appear in the attribute dialogs or are prompted for in the status 
bar. No attributes have this setting by default.</DIV>
</DIV>


<P>
<STRONG>Note!</STRONG> There is an important special case. If there are no 
attributes which you always want to be asked about, the tags for the 
element is immediately inserted and no dialog window is opened. This is 
very convenient as there are many elements which you rarely want any 
attributes for. If you occasionally want some first insert the element and 
then immediately use <A HREF="editing.html#edit"><SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Edit 
tag</SPAN></A> in the <SPAN CLASS="menu">Editing</SPAN> submenu of the HTML 
Utilities menu to give it attributes.
</P>

<H2>Global vs individual settings</H2>

<P>
Using the menu item <SPAN CLASS="item">Attributes Globally</SPAN> the 
dialog box below is opened. Here you can categories some attributes 
globally. These are attributes which are used by very many elements. 
</P>

<DIV>
<IMG SRC="../bilder/attrsglobally.png" ALT="Attributes globally" WIDTH="404"
HEIGHT="181">
</DIV>

<P>
The effect of the two checkboxes at the top of the dialog window will be 
discussed on the <A HREF="doctype.html">next page</A>. We now focus on the 
popup menus.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="item">Use individual settings</SPAN> means that the setting 
for each element apply individually, i.e. there is no global setting for 
this attribute. The other three options are the same as can be used for the 
individual settings. These global settings apply to these attributes 
regardless of which element they belong to.
</P>

<P>
In some cases you would like to use a global setting for some of these 
attributes, but use another setting for only a few elements. There is then 
a possibility to override the global setting. If there is a global setting 
it will be shown in the individual setting which you open using <SPAN
CLASS="menuitem">Use Attributes</SPAN>. Then there is a checkbox 
<B>Override global setting</B>, which lets you use the individual setting 
for this attribute.
</P>
