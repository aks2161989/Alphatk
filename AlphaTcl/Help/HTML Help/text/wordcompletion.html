<H1>Word Completion</H1>

<P>
There is a clever word completion mechanism in HTML mode which saves you 
keystrokes and time while typing. It also helps you to make sure no tags 
are misspelt.
</P>

<P>
As explained elsewhere you can use either dialog windows or the status bar 
to insert new tags, but perhaps you prefer simply to type them. Then the 
word completion mechanism can help you. By default word completion is bound 
to <SPAN CLASS="item">ctrl-tab</SPAN>. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Tip:</B> If you prefer another key binding to ctrl-tab for word 
completion you 
can change it using <SPAN CLASS="menuitem">Config-&gt;Special Keys...</SPAN>
</P>

<P>
How word completion works is best explained with an example. Let us say you 
want to type a TABLE tag. First type
</P>

<P CLASS="code">
&lt;ta
</P>

<P>
If you now hit <SPAN CLASS="itemlight">ctrl-tab</SPAN> this is expanded to
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;TABLE</SPAN>|<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&gt;</SPAN>
    &#8226;
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;/TABLE&gt;</SPAN>
&#8226;
</PRE>

<P>
Alpha sees that you have typed "ta" and finds that TABLE is the only HTML 
element beginning by "TA" and therefore completes "TA" to "TABLE". Alpha 
also automatically inserts a closing tag.
</P>

<P>
Alpha now opens an attribute dialog where you can give values to the
attributes of TABLE. This behavior is customizable. On page 2 in the <A
HREF="prefs.html#General2">general preference dialog</A> you can tell Alpha
not to open this dialog by unchecking <SPAN CLASS="item">Open attribute
dialog after completing an emelent</SPAN>, if you prefer to type also the
attributes. Clicking Cancel in the attribute dialog leaves the insertion
point inside the opening tag, while clicking OK moves the insertion point to
the template stop between the tags. Note that the attribute dialog is only
opened if the element has any attributes, which you have put in the category
<SPAN CLASS="item">Always ask about</SPAN> in the <A
HREF="askedabout.html">Use Attributes</A> dialog. This is the same behavior
as when you insert a template using a menu item for an element.
</P>

<P>
Let us see how you can use word completion to type the attributes. Assume 
you want the attribute CELLSPACING. Type the first few letters
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;TABLE</SPAN> ce|<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&gt;</SPAN>
    &#8226;
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;/TABLE&gt;</SPAN>
&#8226;
</PRE>

<P>
and hit <SPAN CLASS="itemlight">ctrl-tab</SPAN> again. In this case there are two attributes beginning by 
"CE", CELLSPACING and CELLPADDING. If the preference, which is somewhat 
cryptically called <SPAN CLASS="item">List Pick If Mult Cmps</SPAN> is 
checked in the dialog <SPAN 
CLASS="menuitem">Config -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Interface Preferences -&gt; Completions</SPAN> then Alpha opens 
a window where you can choose which of the two attributes you want. Alpha 
then completes "ce" to
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;TABLE</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="attrcode">CELLSPACING=</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="textcode">"</SPAN>|<SPAN CLASS="textcode">"</SPAN>&#8226;<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&gt;</SPAN>
    &#8226;
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;/TABLE&gt;</SPAN>
&#8226;
</PRE>

<P>
You can now type the value you want for CELLSPACING hit <SPAN
CLASS="itemlight">tab</SPAN> and write the 
next attribute.
</P>

<P>
If <SPAN CLASS="item">List Pick If Mult Cmps</SPAN> is not checked Alpha 
will only complete "ce" to "CELL" as it does not know which attribute you 
want.
</P>

<PRE CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;TABLE</SPAN> CELL|<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&gt;</SPAN>&#8226;
    &#8226;
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;/TABLE&gt;</SPAN>
&#8226;
</PRE>

<H3>Word completion when typing attribute values</H3>

<P>
You can also use word completion to expand some attribute values. The types 
for which this is possible are:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Predefined choices</SPAN> Alpha attempts to 
	match against the list of predefined choices.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">URL</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match against  
	your URL cache.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Target window</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against your window cache.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Color</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match against the 
	list of color names.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Content type(s)</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against the list of content types. If you type a list of content types 
	Alpha will attempt to complete the one after the last comma.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Media descriptors</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against the list of media descriptors. If you type a list of media descriptors
	Alpha will attempt to complete the one after the last comma.
	<LI><SPAN CLASS="item">Link types</SPAN> Alpha attempts to match 
	against the list of link types. If you type a list of link 
	types Alpha will attempt to complete the one after the last space.
</UL>

<P>
Let us illustrate this with an example. Say you want the color "yellow" as 
the value of the COLOR attribute of a FONT element. Hitting <SPAN
CLASS="itemlight">ctrl-tab</SPAN> after 
you have typed
</P>

<P CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;FONT </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="attrcode">COLOR=</SPAN><SPAN
CLASS="textcode">"ye</SPAN>|<SPAN CLASS="textcode">"</SPAN><SPAN
CLASS="htmlcode">&gt;</SPAN>
</P>

<P>
makes Alpha complete this to
</P>

<P CLASS="code">
<SPAN CLASS="htmlcode">&lt;FONT </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="attrcode">COLOR=</SPAN><SPAN
CLASS="textcode">"#FFFF00"</SPAN><SPAN
CLASS="htmlcode">&gt;</SPAN>
</P>

Word completion can also help you when you are editing CSS and JavaScript.
