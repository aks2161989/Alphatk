<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
This manual describes three of Alpha's many modes, HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript modes. 

<H2>HTML mode</H2>

<P>
<B>HTML mode</B> is for editing HyperText Markup Language (HTML) 
documents and Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) documents
(suffix <B>.html</B>, <B>.htm</B> or <B>.shtml</B>).  Whenever 
you open or save a file with a name with any of these suffixes, Alpha 
switches to HTML mode and inserts three menus in the menu bar. The first 
one <IMG SRC="../bilder/cssmenuicon.png" ALT="CSS menu icon" WIDTH="30"
HEIGHT="22" CLASS="iconpic"> is called the <B>CSS menu</B> and contains 
functions for editing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The second one <IMG
SRC="../bilder/htmlmenuicon.png" ALT="HTML menu icon" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22"
CLASS="iconpic"> is called the <B>HTML menu</B> and the last one <IMG
SRC="../bilder/htmlutilsmenuicon.png" ALT="HTML Utilities menu icon"
WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22" CLASS="iconpic"> the <B>HTML Utilities menu</B>.
<IMG SRC="../bilder/modesmeny.png" ALT="Modes menu" WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="61"
CLASS="rightpic">
</P>


<P>
You can always manually switch to HTML mode with the popup mode menu in the 
status bar in the lower right corner of your screen, see the picture to the 
right. Alpha has many different modes giving you different features 
depending on which type of document you are editing. When you edit HTML 
documents, make sure you are using HTML mode.
</P>

<P>
The basic idea with this HTML environment is to save you time while typing, 
by providing powerful tools for editing HTML code. HTML mode can help you 
to learn HTML, but it requires that you have some basic knowledge of HTML 
to be useful. However, you don't have to be an HTML expert and know every 
single element and every single attribute.
</P>

<P>
This manual is only a manual for Alpha's HTML, JavaScript, and CSS modes. 
It does not describe any of the many other modes Alpha has, and not any of 
Alpha's many other features. They are documented elsewhere. You can open 
many different help files under the system help menu. If you haven't used 
Alpha at all before I recommend that you at least read the Quick Start 
before reading this manual.
</P>

<H3>JavaScript and CSS modes</H3>

<P>
In HTML mode there is support for editing of both JavaScript and CSS within
HTML documents. There are also a separate <B>JavaScript mode</B> for editing
JavaScript documents (suffix <B>.js</B>) and a <B>CSS mode</B> for editing
CSS documents (suffix <B>.css</B>). When Alpha switches to CSS mode it
inserts the CSS menu <IMG SRC="../bilder/cssmenuicon.png"
ALT="CSS menu icon" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="22" CLASS="iconpic"> in the menu bar.
JavaScript mode does not have its own menu.
</P>

<P>
<B>Note</B> that within HTML mode the coloring of JavaScript and CSS 
keywords is not enabled by default. This is because it's more convenient to 
have it disabled if you are not using JavaScript or CSS. Read the 
<A HREF="coloring.html">Coloring</A> section of this manual to see what to do to enable coloring 
of JavaScript and CSS keywords.
</P>

<H3>HTML mode features</H3>

<UL CLASS="features">
	<LI>HTML mode knows HTML 4.0, XHTML 1.0 and 1.1, and some of Netscape's and Microsoft's 
	extensions to HTML.
	<LI>Tools to easily and quickly insert HTML elements and give them 
	attributes.
	<LI>Many smart shortcuts for quick editing of HTML code.
	<LI>A clever word completion feature to save you time while typing.
	<LI>Customizable indentation of the code and a feature to reformat 
	messy code to make it more readable.
	<LI>You can open windows with lists of files from where you can easily 
	copy and paste to make links.
	<LI>Validation of the HTML code.
	<LI>Tools for building lists and tables.
	<LI>You can check that all links between your files are OK.
	<LI>You can move files between folders and automatically update all 
	links between and in them.
	<LI>Support for dynamically included files.
	<LI>Conversion of NCSA and CERN image map files to client side image 
	maps.
	<LI>Support for editing of JavaScript.
	<LI>Support for editing of Cascading Style Sheets level 2.
	<LI>Uploading of complete sites with FTP.
	<LI>Files are sent to your browser with one key stroke.
	<LI>Any menu item can be bound to any single key stroke.

	for Alpha to be updated to use it for new HTML.
	<LI>etc. etc.

<H3><A NAME="acknowledgment">Acknowledgments</A></H3>

<P>
First of all, I would like to thank Pete Keleher for writing Alpha, the 
best editor in the world, without which my Tcl code would be pretty 
useless. Many thanks to all other Alpha Tcl authors, in particular Vince 
Darley, who is currently leading the development of Alpha's core Tcl 
features.  I am also indebted to Scott Brim who wrote the first version of 
Alpha's HTML mode.  Some original ideas and tcl code were taken by him from 
html.el for GNU Emacs and latex.tcl for Alpha.  Fran&ccedil;ois Pottier 
gave me lots of help with the code which makes Alpha talk to Big Brother. 
The algorithm for extracting the width and height of JPEG images were 
written by Alex Knowles and Andrew Tong.  Many thanks to Michael O'Henly 
for making the wonderful <A 
HREF="http://hem.fyristorg.com/alpha_www_tools/intro/" TARGET="_top">Alpha 
HTML mode intro site</A>.  He has also sent me a list with corrections of 
the language in an earlier version of this manual. (But his correction are 
gone by now as the manual is completely rewritten. :-)  And thanks to 
everybody who has sent me suggestions and bug reports.  You know who you 
are.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="feedback">Feedback</A></H3>

<P>
All comments on HTML mode are welcome. Many features in HTML mode were 
suggested by HTML mode users. Don't hesitate to send me your ideas. Please 
tell me if you find a bug which annoys you. If you tell me about it I'll do 
my best to fix it. If you don't tell me about it I may not discover it 
myself.
</P>

<H3>A postcard, please...</H3>

<P>
Writing HTML mode has taken a considerable amount of time.  Therefore, if 
you like HTML mode and use it a lot, I would very much appreciate it if you 
send me a colorful postcard and tell me that.  It would give me new energy 
to add new features to HTML mode.  Note that emails don't count as 
postcards.  Emails are not pretty enough to put on the wall. My address is

My mother tongue is Swedish.  Therefore you will, no doubt, find 
grammatical and other errors in this manual and in HTML mode.

But before you complain, I must tell you that I know that "color" is spelt 
"colour".  :-)
