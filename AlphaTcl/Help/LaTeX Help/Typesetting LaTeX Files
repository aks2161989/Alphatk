	  	Introduction

Alpha supports typesetting with OzTeX, CMacTeX, Textures, TeXShop, and more,
and for multiple OS platforms, but if can be difficult to configure all of
the available preferences to make everything work correctly.

	  	Preferences

We current have these preferences:

"Config > Global Setup > Helper Applications"

(See the preferences: HelperApplications dialog)

	TeX Signature

"Config > TeX Mode Prefs > Preferences"

(See the preferences: Mode-TeX dialog)

	Additional TeX Flags
	Run TeX In Back
	Show TeX Log
	Use Textures Flash Mode
	Version For CMacTeX
	Version For Textures

"TeX Menu > TeX Format"

	TeX Format
	Auto Adjust Format

"TeX Menu > TeX Program"

	TeX Program


so the number of variations is incredibly high, and one wrong setting can
disable the typesetting of your file.  (For most TeX helpers, only a few of
these are important anyway, but it is hard to know in advance which ones
matter.)


	  	Using Alpha with 'teTeX'


A separate "teTeX Help" file explains how to use Alpha with tetex.


	  	Typesetting Trouble-shooting

The most common problem users encounter involve the "Tex Format/Program"
preferences.  Please try setting these to

	TeX Format  : tex
	TeX Program : LaTeX

and try to typeset the file again to see if that helps.  Yes, we know that
these settings are confusing, and we hope to explain them better in the
future.  Until then, please see this web page:

<http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/wikipages/typesetting-files>

Eventually, this document will contain information on how all of these items 
should be set for different applications and platforms.
