LaTeX Mode -- An extension package for Alpha


                                               version: 5.0
                                               created: 06/30/1996 {07:44:13 pm}

Welcome to Alpha's LaTeX mode, a package designed to simplify the input and
processing of LaTeX documents.  This is the "LaTeX Help Introduction" file
available from the "TeX Menu > LaTeX Help" menu.

This help file is an Alpha hypertext document.  Hyperlinks are colored green
or magenta and underlined.  Click on a link to jump to another part of the
document or open another help file.  You can use the keyboard shortcut for
"Search > Return To Bookmark" to return the cursor to its previous position.
Note: Some links are url documents on the World Wide Web, which require an
Internet connection.

TeX mode has been constructed for LaTeX 2e (it may also work with other older
versions of latex or pure TeX).  The TeX menu is very customizable, allowing
you to change nearly any key-binding, or to add new menu item templates.  See
the options available in the "TeX Menu > LaTeX Menu" submenu.

There are a number of additional Alpha packages which enhance the use of LaTeX
mode (click to read more about them):

  package: latexAccents
  package: latexBbToViewport
  package: latexColors
  package: latexMathbb
  package: latexSizes

You may wish to activate these (via "Config > Preference > Features") and test
some of these to see whether you'd find them useful.

Preferences: Mode-Features-TeX

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

The full, detailed user's guide for Alpha LaTeX mode is available in pdf
format:

      <<TeX::menuProc {LaTeX Help} {Users Guide - pdf}>>

Click on this hyperlink to view the file using your preferred browser.

Or you can view the .tex source file through the following links:

	е User's Guide:        an introduction to the Alpha LaTeX macros

      <<TeX::menuProc {LaTeX Help} {Users Guide - tex}>>

	е LaTeX Menus:         commands and bindings (organized by menu)

      <<TeX::menuProc {LaTeX Help} {LaTeX Menus - tex}>>

	е LaTeX Key Bindings:  commands and bindings (organized by command key)

      <<TeX::menuProc {LaTeX Help} {LaTeX Key Bindings - tex}>>

Clicking on one of these links opens a .tex file and inserts the LaTeX menu
into your menubar.  To typeset the document, pull down the LaTeX menu and
choose the 'typeset' command on the Typeset submenu (or press Command-T).
Choose the 'view' or 'print' command on the Typeset submenu to view or print
the document (or press Shift-Command-V or Shift-Command-P), respectively.

Users of "teTeX" should read "teTeX Help" for more information about how to
use Alpha with this command line version of TeX.

Finally, be sure to check out the Completions tutorial, "TeX Tutorial v1.3.tex".
	
Happy LaTeXing!

	  	Version History


	  	 	5.0

Version 5.0 introduces some major changes.  The main one of these is the
introduction of a much better way for users to define key bindings, via the
new submenu "TeX Menu > LaTeX Menu" which presents an easy to use dialog
for defining bindings without knowing anything about Tcl or AlphaTcl.

This same menu also allows the user to define new templates for any 'Text'
or 'Math' submenu, which will also be saved between editing sessions.

Some electric completions have been removed, after several users complained
(c.f. Bug# 806) that they were too user (and Anglo) specific -- these
include the completions for "Appendix" "Section" etc.  which allow one to
choose the proper "\ref{...}" string.

If you want to restore them, create a "TeXPrefs.tcl" file and add the
following Tcl code:

	set TeXelectrics(Appendix)         "╫kill0Appendix~\\ref\{еlabelе\}ее"
	set TeXelectrics(Chapter)          "╫kill0Chapter~\\ref\{еlabelе\}ее"
	set TeXelectrics(Eq.)              "~\\eqref\{еlabelе\}ее"
	set TeXelectrics(Figure)           "╫kill0Figure~\\ref\{еlabelе\}ее"
	set TeXelectrics(Section)          "╫kill0Section~\\ref\{еlabelе\}ее"
	set TeXelectrics(Table)            "~\\ref\{еlabelе\}ее"

This code will be sourced each time that Alpha is launched, after you have
opened a file in TeX mode.

Other changes include:

 е 'Use Short Menu' broken into two preferences, to allow either the Text
   or Math submenus to be included in the main menu.
 е 'LaTeX Help' menu item replaced by a submenu, giving access to the 
   various documents available.
 е Open Windows Hook now dims items appropriately.
 е "dontIndentLaTeXenvironments" renamed to "indentLaTeXenvironments",
   and is now used for inserting all environments including electrics and
   "Environments" menu items.
 е Except for the "document" environment, else we indent the entire file.
 е Simplification (hopefully) of the prefs which determine how the format
   is selected for newer version of CMacTeX.
 е No format name is ever inserted when opening a file -- instead, the
   current format is auto-adjusted if the first line in the .tex file
   starts with something like "%$LaTeX".  
 е Many, many improvements based on AlphaTcl 7.5 procs.
 е A new "Use Label Prefixes" preference determines if labels are inserted
   with names like \label{ref:|} or simply \label{|} where "|" indicates
   the cursor position.  This is initially turned off.

	  	 	4.3-4.7

 е better support for Alphatk
 е some new key-bindings
 е process menu dims items which can't be used
 е some support for latexpdf
 е TeXInputsFolder replaced by TeXSearchPath which is a list of 
   folders rather than just a single folder.
 е allowed use of CMacTeX's xdvi and ghostview viewers
 е bunch of improvements
 е requires Alpha 7.0p4
 е allowed use of tex-xet CMacTeX app with sig 'BTxT'
 е some improvements to various menus, and some new key-bindings.  
   Note that you can easily add your own bindings like this, say:

	menu::replaceWith "Binary Operators" \
	  [list "vee" "wedge" "setminus"] \
	  items "/V<Ivee" "/W<Iwedge" "/-<Isetminus"

 е preliminary support for making glossaries with makeindex --- slight
   problem in that the appleevents sent don't indicate to use a 
   glossary style file to makeindex so unless it looks at the .glo 
   extension and makes the right choice, you may have to tell it
   by hand.
 е Math Environments menu adjusted for AMS-LaTeX (align etc, and no eqnarray)
 е internal changes to math-env procedures (still more to do)
 е better use of citation referencing/creating new bib entries.
 е better handling of labels, environments
 е requires Alpha 7.0p1
 
	  	 	4.2

 е better sectioning menu
 е new theorem menu (many thanks Paul Gastin <Paul.Gastin@liafa.jussieu.fr>)
 е couple of fixes to insertion/package searching
 е untitled windows or 'saveAs' windows now result in the typeset menu
   being updated correctly (requires the core bugfix included).
 е Environment completion rewritten
 е new or better list/table env construction thanks to Pierre BASSO
 е numerous small bugs fixed (all those reported so far, I believe)
 е package: latexAccents separate package now

	  	 	4.1 - 4.1.1

 е package: latexSizes a little better.
 е smart-Paste now works for TeX mode.
 е nicer handling of TeXinBackground flag -- the typeset menu changes
   to reflect the value of the flag.
 е bug fixes in "latexComm.tcl"
 е menus rewritten to allow user additions using Alpha's new 
   'proc: menu::insert' commands.
 е Vince Darley <vince@santafe.edu> has taken over maintenance
   of LaTeX mode.
 е Better support for elec-Completions
 е Format menu works
 е Simplified quite a few things
 е LaTeX Help menu item works again
 е Renamed *AppSig to *AppSign so there's no conflict with 'Helpers'
 е LaTeX menu icon switching now handled by Alpha.
 е Textures code only registered if we use textures.
 е requires Alpha 7.0fc1p2
 е proc: smartScripts now use a pref-binding so international users can use 
   them more easily.

	  	 	4.0

 е Updated for Alpha 7.0.  Old versions will not work.

Here's brief documentation on new features: 

You can use proc: menu::insert to add items to pretty much all of the latex 
menu.  For instance if you've defined a new format, you can add that 
to the menu with 'menu::insert Format items end Vince-Article' (say).  
See general Alpha documentation for more details on that command.  
You'll have to scan through the file "latexMenu.tcl" to find the name 
of the menu to which you want to add something.

You may want package: latexSizes or package: latexAccents (available separately)

You may want to try package: electricCompletions (try the completions
tutorial for latex mode, "TeX Tutorial v1.3.tex").


	  	 	3.3

 е AMS-LaTeX is here!  Check the "AMS-LaTeX" menu item on the 
   "LaTeX Utilities" submenu.
 е Added the command 'chooseEnvironment' (bound to <Shf Cmd E>) to 
   the "Environments" and "Math Environments" submenus.  This 
   command is a convenient keyboard-bound method of inserting LaTeX 
   environments.  The 'general' command, previously bound to <Opt 
   F12>, is gone.
 е Added the identifiers "fig:", "tbl:", and "eq:" to the \label 
   commands generated inside figure, table, and equation 
   environments, respectively.  Also added the "eq:" identifier to 
   the eqnarray environment.
 е Made improvements to the sectioning commands on the Sectioning 
   submenu.  In particular, the \part and \chapter commands include 
   \thispagestyle{empty} by default.
 е Added the starred equivalents of all the sectioning commands.  
   With the Sectioning submenu down, press the <Opt> key to access 
   these new commands.
 е Fixed a bug in 'typeset' so that it now recognizes a window 
   with a funny title like "foo.tex <2>".
 е Added a 'Text Commands' submenu with many new commands.
 е Removed 'ellipsis', 'em-dash', and 'en-dash' from the 
   Miscellaneous submenu.  The latter two commands are now on the 
   'Text Commands' submenu.
 е Replaced the 'з' command on the International submenu with 
   the 'ss' and 'SS' commands, which insert the LaTeX commands \ss 
   and \SS, respectively, at the insertion point.
 е Changed the name of 'isDocumentSelected' (in "latexEngine.tcl") 
   to 'isSelectionAll', so that it corresponds with 'proc: isSelection' 
   in "procs.tcl".
 е Moved the procs 'latex', 'bibtex', and 'makeindex' from 
   "latexMacros.tcl" to "latexComm.tcl".
 е Created a new file called "latexUtilities.tcl", which is sourced
   on demand.  Moved the procs 'deleteTabStops', 'deleteComments', 
   'convertQuotes', and 'convertDollarSigns' from "latexMacros.tcl" 
   to "latexUtilities.tcl".
 е Added the commands "Convert Accents to LaTeX" and "Convert 
   LaTeX to Accents" to the LaTeX Utilities submenu.  The 
   corresponding code (in "latexUtilities.tcl") was written by 
   F. Miguel DionТsio <fmd@math.ist.utl.pt>.
 е Created a new file called "latexNavigation.tcl", which is 
   sourced on demand.  Moved many of the procs on the Goto submenu 
   from "latexMacros.tcl" to "latexNavigation.tcl".
 е The file "latexSmart.tcl" is now sourced on demand.
 е Added the command 'deleteProc' to "latexEngine.tcl", which does 
   the obvious thing.
 е Updated the LaTeX documentation.
 
	  	 	3.2t

 е Added a new Textures' interface, specifically designed for 
   Textures version 1.8.  The primary advantage of Textures over the 
   other TeX implementations is the capability of multiple windows, 
   which Alpha now supports.
 е Added non-functional menu filters to the Text Size, International, 
   and Arrows submenus, which appears to fix some problems.  (I have no 
   idea why this works!)  Thanks to Johan Linde <jl@theophys.kth.se> for 
   the suggestion.
 е Fixed the 'll' command on the Relations submenu.
 е Fixed a bug that prevented users from specifying the "latexMenu" 
   in Config:Global:Menus.
 е Added a "LaTeX Help" command to the LaTeX menu.  This command 
   does the same thing as choosing "LaTeX Help" from the System help 
   menu (under the question mark).
 е Updated the LaTeX documentation.
 
	  	 	3.2

 е Rewrote and reorganized the Alpha LaTeX documentation.  The primary 
   help file is now distributed as both a LaTeX file and an HTML file 
   (generated by latex2html).  See the "LaTeX Help" document on the 
   System help menu (under the question mark) for a summary.
 е Totally rewrote "latexMenu.tcl" so that it's more modular.  Users may 
   now easily modify the LaTeX menu.  (See the "Installation" section 
   in the new User's Guide.)
 е Implemented Chris Higgins' <C.Higgins@cit.gu.edu.au> version of 
   "latexProjects.tcl".  Later implemented Vince Darley's
   <vince@das.harvard.edu> more powerful version of "latexProjects.tcl".  
   In the end, however, Vince incorporated LaTeX projects directly into 
   the Fileset menu.
 е Put 'typeset' on a dynamic submenu called Typeset.  The 'typeset' 
   command (bound to <Cmd T>) now displays the name of the file to be 
   typeset.  If the current file can not be typeset (e.g., if it's a .log 
   file or an .aux file) or if there are no open windows, the user is 
   asked to locate a file to be typeset.
 е Modified 'typesetSelection' so that it resolves top-level input 
   files.  In other words, there's a high probability that the current 
   selection will be typeset by the TeX app without error or warning.  
   Thanks to Pierre Basso <Pierre.Basso@lim.univ-mrs.fr> for bug reports 
   and advice.
 е Added a 'typesetClipboard' command to the Typeset submenu, bound 
   to <Shf Cmd T>.  The contents of the clipboard are sent to the TeX 
   application in a plain vanilla LaTeX wrapper.
 е Added 'viewDVI' and 'printDVI' to the Typeset submenu, bound to <Shf 
   Cmd V> and <Shf Cmd P>, respectively.  Also added 'dvips', 'viewPS', 
   and 'printPS' to the Typeset submenu.  All commands display the name 
   of the file to be processed.
 е Added 'bibtex' and 'makeindex' to the Typeset submenu.  All known 
   BibTeX and MakeIndex apps are supported.
 е Any LaTeX auxiliary file (.log, .aux, etc.) may be opened and 
   displayed.  While the Typeset submenu is down, press the option key 
   to see various 'open' commands.  Other such commands are found on 
   the "Other Files" submenu on the Typeset submenu, including a 
   command that lets you open any file in the current directory (bound 
   to <Shf Cmd O>).
 е Relocated the 'removeAuxiliaryFiles' command from the LaTeX Utilities 
   submenu to the new Typeset submenu.
 е Alpha LaTeX now writes all temporary files to "$PREFS:tmp:", which 
   makes them easier to remove.  All temporary files are removed once, 
   at launch; however, the new command 'removeTemporaryFiles' on the 
   Typeset submenu removes all temporary files immediately.
 е The short menu is now installed by default.  Remove the tick on 
   "Short LaTeX Menu" (a checkable menu item) on the "LaTeX Utilities" 
   submenu to install the long menu.
 е Alpha now launches applications by signature, not name.  This 
   means you can freely change the names of your TeX-related apps, so 
   long as the applications themselves don't mind. :-)  Application 
   signatures may be viewed and removed with the 'viewSavedSetting' and 
   'removeSavedSetting' commands on the Config menu.
 е Every time 'texSig' is altered (either by choosing the command
   'removeSavedSetting' on the Config menu or opening a new TeX app), 
   the LaTeX menu is rebuilt and the corresponding small icon is 
   inserted into Alpha's menu bar.  For most users, this will be a 
   one-time operation.
 е Alpha's TeX mode search path (used when cmd-dbl-clicking the 
   arguments of \input and \include commands, for instance) has been 
   extended to *two* levels of subfolders.  First, the current directory 
   is searched, then 'TeXInputs' (a global variable optionally set with 
   the 'appPaths' command on the Config menu) and finally any TeX-inputs 
   folder recognized by your TeX app.  The search path is generated the 
   first time it's needed (rather than on-the-fly) and thereafter when 
   the values 'texSig' or 'TeXInputs' are changed (i.e., not very often).
 е The proc 'buildSubMenu' in "DblClickAux.tcl" has been modified 
   to accomodate its use in "latexMenu.tcl".  (See below for a 
   description of the new 'packages' submenu.)
 е Redesigned the Documents submenu.  Choosing "New Document" (or 
   pressing <Shf Cmd N>) brings up a dialog with a pop-up menu of 
   standard document types.  This command creates a new TeX window, 
   inserts a document of the requested type, and automatically runs 
   the 'options' command (which is still on the Documents submenu).  
   The old commands 'article', 'letter', etc. will be found on the 
   "Insert Document" subsubmenu.  Each such command behaves as it did 
   before, that is, it inserts a document template into an empty window 
   or wraps the entire contents of the current window.
 е Modified the 'usepackage' command (bound to <Ctl Opt U>) on the 
   Documents submenu so that it inserts "\usepackage" immediately after 
   the \documentclass command regardless of the current location of the 
   insertion point.
 е Added 'filecontentsAll' to the Documents submenu, which creates a 
   single, self-contained LaTeX document (for file transfer, say) from 
   the current document.
 е Added a flag called 'buildPkgsSubmenu', which is turned off by 
   default.  Check this flag in the 'currentMode:flags' dialog on the 
   Config menu to enable the Packages submenu (see below).
 е The Packages submenu contains a list of all packages known to the 
   TeX app.  Choosing one of these packages inserts the corresponding 
   \usepackage command into the preamble of the current document.  To 
   build this submenu, enable the flag 'buildPkgsSubmenu' as described 
   above, and then choose the 'rebuildDocumentsSubmenu' command on the 
   Documents submenu.
 е SmartScripts are temporarily turned off when the cursor is inside 
   the required argument of any LaTeX command taking a filename as input 
   (e.g., \input, \include, \usepackage, \documentclass, etc.).  Vince 
   Darley <vince@das.harvard.edu> provided the essential ingredient for 
   this new feature.
 е The commands 'latex', 'bibtex', and 'makeindex' on the Goto 
   submenu recognize additional TeX-related applications.
 е Added 'writeFile' (complementary to 'readFile') to "DblClickAux.tcl".
 е Improved the DirectTeX Pro interface courtesy of Ivan Alves 
   <ivan.alves@ci.educ.lu>.
 е Added the general-purpose procs 'buildStructure', 'insertStructure',
   'wrapStructure', and 'doWrapStructure' to "latexEngine.tcl".  (Tcl 
   programmers take note!)
 е Added the flag 'useBrackets', set to false, by default.  If set 
   to true, "\[...\]" will be used in multi-line math displays instead 
   of "\begin{displaymath}...\end{displaymath}".
 е The body of a table or figure environment now begins with a 
   \centering command (not \centerline).
 е Multi-line delimiters have finally arrived!  With the Delimiters 
   submenu down, press the <Opt> key to see the possibilities.
 е Added 'overrightarrow' and 'overleftarrow' to the Grouping submenu.
 е Fixed a bug in 'gotoTabStop', a proc in "latexMacros.tcl" used by 
   'nextTabStop' and 'prevTabStop'.
 е Changed the command key for the 'chooseCommand' command on the 
   LaTeX Utilities submenu from <Shf Cmd T> to <Shf Cmd C>.  (Sorry, 
   Pete!)
 е Changed the name of the TeX mode variable 'boxMacroName' to 
   'boxMacroNames'.  The latter now takes a *list* of macro names, which 
   is set to "includegraphics includegraphics*" by default.
 е The TeX mode flag 'useBoxMacro' is gone.  When inserting a figure 
   environment, the user is asked to choose one of the box macros stored 
   in 'boxMacroNames'.  If the choice is left blank, the current 
   selection (if there is one) is wrapped inside the figure environment.

	  	 	3.1

 е Pete added Vince Darley's excellent fill routines to Alpha proper.  
   LaTeX users, in particular, will notice big improvements when filling 
   paragraphs and regions in TeX mode.
 е Implemented a shortened version of the LaTeX menu, which may be 
   installed by checking 'shortLaTeXMenu' on the LaTeX Utilities submenu.
 е Fixed some bugs in 'chooseCommand' and generalized it so that other 
   modes could use it as well.  Changed its command key from <Opt Cmd T> 
   to <Shf Cmd T> to accomodate the new 'typesetSelection' command 
   described below.
 е Added a new command called 'typesetSelection' <Opt Cmd T>, which 
   typesets any selection (i.e., region) within the document environment.  
   To see this new command, pull down the main menu, and with the cursor on 
   the 'typeset' command, press the <Opt> key.
 е The LaTeX utility 'removeAuxiliaryFiles' now searches for ALL auxiliary 
   files in the current directory, regardless of the base filename.  Two 
   buttons were also added to the dialog:  the command "rm ext" removes all 
   files with the same extension as the file displayed in the dialog, and 
   "rm all" removes all auxiliary files from the current directory without 
   prompting.
 е Tightened the input validation routines used in 'nthTabStop', 
   'enumerate', 'itemize', 'description', 'thebibliography', 'tabular', 
   'eqnarrayStar', 'eqnarray', and 'myArray'.  [Note:  Tcl programmers
   will want to look at the generally useful routines 'isInteger', 
   'isUnsignedInteger', and 'isPositiveInteger' in "latexEngine.tcl".]
 е Fixed a bug in the automatic typesetting routines that prevented 
   Alpha from finding the PPC version of Textures.
 е Improved the communication between Alpha and DirectTeX Pro.  
   (Thanks to Alun Carr <ajcarr@ccvax.ucd.ie> and Ivan Alves
   <alves@econ.ubc.ca> for this modification.)
 е 'TeXMarkFile' now marks \input and \include files (thanks to Vince 
   Darley).  To mark a file, choose "Mark File" on the mark menu on the 
   tool bar at the right of each window.
 е The keybindings for '(la)texMath' and '(la)texDisplaymath' on the 
   Math Modes submenu have been changed to <Ctl Cmd M> and <Ctl Opt Cmd 
   M>, respectively, primarily for compatibility with international 
   keyboards.  The old keybindings <Ctl Cmd 4> and <Ctl Opt Cmd 4> are 
   still available, however.
 е The 'insertReference' command (formerly on the LaTeX Utilities 
   submenu) has been removed to make way for Vince Darley's new 
   improved 'ref' and 'pageref' commands (see below).
 е To use Vince Darley's new reference completion facility:  press 
   <Ctl Opt X> or <Ctl Opt P> to insert a \ref or \pageref command, 
   respectively.  The inserted command will contain the argument of the 
   nearest \label command.  Continue pressing <Ctl Opt X> or <Ctl Opt P> 
   to cycle through all the \label commands in your document.
 е Fixed a serious bug with 'useBoxMacro' and 'boxMacroName'.  (See 
   the "LaTeX Help" file for descriptions of these TeX variables.)
 е Updated and polished the Alpha LaTeX document latex_macros.tex 
   (commands organized by menu) and created a new latex_bindings.tex 
   (commands organized by command key), both of which are found in 
   Alpha's LaTeX folder.
 е The commands 'oneParameter' <Ctl Cmd 1> and 'twoParameters' 
   <Ctl Cmd 2> no longer bring up a dialog (which just gets in the way).  
   If there is a selection, these commands now wrap that selection.
 е All the commands on the Text Style submenu now have command keys, 
   namely, <Ctl Opt 1>, <Ctl Opt 2>, etc., through <Ctl Opt 0>.
 е Each of the commands 'lim', 'inf', 'sup', 'liminf', 'limsup', 
   'min', and 'max', now inserts a subscript automatically.  For 
   example, the 'lim' command (now bound to <Ctl Cmd L>) inserts 
   the string "\lim_{е}".  After insertion, press the <Del> key twice 
   to get rid of this subscript, if desired.
 е Changed the name of 'custom' to 'generic' on the Documents 
   submenu, and assigned it the command key <Ctl Opt D>.
 е Added 'usepackage' to the Documents submenu, bound to <Ctl Opt U>. 
 е Added 'verb' to the Miscellaneous submenu, bound to <Ctl Opt V>.
 е Bound 'underbrace' and 'overbrace' to <Ctl Opt Cmd U> and
   <Ctl Opt Cmd O>, respectively.
 е Added the declarative counterparts to each of the Text Style 
   commands.  These can be seen by pulling down the Text Style submenu 
   and pressing the <Shf> key.
 е Added 'nocite' <Shf Ctl Opt C> to the Miscellaneous submenu.


	  	 	3.0

 е Designed and implemented a totally new set of key bindings.  This 
   was necessary because the old LaTeX bindings conflicted with Alpha's 
   new key bindings and many international keyboards.
 е The LaTeX menu now displays key bindings, whenever possible.
 е Fixed a bug in "latexSmart.tcl" (formerly "smart.tcl") which prevented 
   a user from typing a literal double quote (\").
 е Added a 'smartQuotes' flag to the default list of flags on the "check" 
   pop-up menu, so that users could turn off this feature on demand.
 е Added 'convertQuotes' to the LaTeX Utilities submenu.  If there 
   is a selection, 'convertQuotes' converts all straight quotes to 
   curved quotes (LaTeX-style) within the selection; otherwise, it 
   processes the entire window.
 е Added a "smart dots" feature so that three consecutive dots (...) 
   are automatically replaced with \ldots.  This can be turned off with 
   the 'smartDots' flag on the "check" pop-up menu.
 е Smart quotes and dots can be escaped on-the-fly by pressing the 
   <Delete> key.  For example, with 'smartQuotes' enabled, type a double
   quote at the keyboard.  Unless preceded with a backslash, this double
   quote will automatically be replaced by a pair of curved single quotes
   (LaTeX-style).  Pressing the <Delete> key will bring the original double 
   quote back.
 е Added a 'smartScripts' flag to the "check" pop-up menu.  Enabled by 
   default, this feature binds the <_> and <^> keys to 'formulas:subscript' 
   and 'formulas:superscript', respectively.  As with smart quotes and dots, 
   smart scripts may be escaped on-the-fly by pressing the <Delete> key.
 е Fixed a bug that inserted an extra blank line between the rows of 
   an array environment.
 е Repaired the note environment.
 е Added DirectTeX Pro and Euro-OzTeX to the list of supported TeX 
   implementations.  (Thanks to Alun Carr and Michel Moreaux for the 
   patches.)
 е The proc 'typeset' now processes an untitled or unsaved TeX window 
   by first asking the user if the window should be saved.  If the answer 
   is "no", then 'typeset' goes ahead and passes the contents of the window 
   to the LaTeX application anyway, which is very handy for on-the-fly 
   testing and debugging.  Temporary files are stored in $PREFS and cleaned 
   up the next time Alpha launches.
 е Added the flag 'runTeXInBackground' to the "check" pop-up menu.  Tick 
   this option if you want to 'typeset' your LaTeX documents in the 
   background.
 е Added 'fillColumn' and 'leftFillColumn' to the default list of 
   TeX mode variables available on the "check" pop-up menu.
 е The 'useDollarSigns' flag works again!
 е Fixed numerous bugs in the proc 'convertDollarSigns'.
 е This version of "latex.tcl" completely takes over the numeric keypad 
   (except for the clear/numLock key, which now toggles the keypad in 
   any mode).
 е Added many new navigation commands to the Goto submenu:  'prevCommand' 
   <Kpad4>; 'nextCommand' <Kpad6>; 'prevCommandSelect' <Shf Kpad4>; 
   'nextCommandSelect' <Shf Kpad6>; 'prevEnvironment' <Cmd Kpad4>; 
   'nextEnvironment' <Cmd Kpad6>; 'prevEnvironmentSelect' 
   <Shf Cmd Kpad4>; and 'nextEnvironmentSelect' <Shf Cmd Kpad6>.
   Also added two additional commands on an experimental basis:  
   'prevCommandSelectWithArgs' <Shf Opt Kpad4> and 
   'nextCommandSelectWithArgs' <Shf Opt Kpad6> (see Bugs below).
 е In addition to the old navigation commands 'prevSection' 
   <Cmd Kpad8>, 'nextSection' <Cmd Kpad2>, 'prevSubsection' 
   <Kpad8>, and 'nextSubsection' <Kpad2>, there are four new commands 
   'prevSectionSelect' <Shf Cmd Kpad8>, 'nextSectionSelect' 
   <Shf Cmd Kpad2>, 'prevSubsectionSelect' <Shf Kpad8>, and 
   'nextSubsectionSelect' <Shf Kpad2>.  The latter make it easy to 
   select large blocks of text (i.e., complete sections or subsections).
 е Fixed some minor bugs in the tab stop mechanism, including a 
   bug in 'gotoTabStop' that caused it to find a tab stop immediately 
   to the right of the cursor when searching backwards, and another in 
   'nthTabStop'.  The latter now handles ANY input, including zero.
 е The following interactive procedures now validate the user's input:
   'nthTabStop', 'enumerate', 'itemize', 'description', 'thebibliography', 
   'tabular', 'myArray', 'eqnarrayStar', 'eqnarray'.  Invalid input 
   simply causes the procedure to terminate.
 е Put 'insertLiteralTab' and 'insertTabStop' on the LaTeX Utilities 
   submenu, if for no other reason but to advertise the key bindings.  
   Note:  The proc 'insertTabStop' is bound to <Opt 8> on US keyboards.
 е The 'filecontents' command on the Documents submenu finally works!
 е Removed 'loadSymbolPackage' from the LaTeX Utilities submenu 
   because the symbol package (latexsym) can be loaded with the 
   'packages' command on the Documents submenu.  The latter now checks 
   to see if the chosen package is already loaded.
 е Merged 'item' and 'bibitem' on the Miscellaneous submenu into a 
   single command: 'item' now inserts either \item, \item[], or \bibitem{} 
   depending on the context, and is bound to <Ctl Opt J>.
 е Reorganized the Math Environments submenu for conceptual purposes.  
   (The array environment, in particular, is different than the other 
   environments since it MUST be used in math mode, whereas the others 
   must NEVER be used in math mode).
 е The table environment now puts the caption at the top.  (The 
   figure environment still puts the caption at the bottom.)
 е Tom Pollard fixed 'TeXMarkFile' so that the "{}" pop-up menu is 
   more readable.
 е Using Alpha's new command-double-click facility, Tom Pollard 
   wrote a routine that chases references and citations.  Simply 
   command-double-click the required argument of a \ref or \cite 
   (which are now underlined) to find the corresponding \label or 
   \bibitem, respectively.  It will even open a .bib file, if necessary.
 е Andreas Amann added \pageref, \input, \include, and \bibliography 
   to the list of (underlined) commands whose required arguments can now 
   be command-double-clicked.
 е Added \usepackage, \documentclass, \RequirePackage, and \LoadClass to 
   the list of (underlined) LaTeX commands.  Also, the required argument of 
   the command specified in the TeX mode variable 'boxMacroName' 
   (\includegraphics, by default) may also be command-double-clicked.
 е The user-defined variable 'boxMacroName' on the "check" pop-up menu 
   is now dimmed if the flag 'useBoxMacro' is set to false.
 е Changed the name of the "Styles" command to "Options", and added 
   the remaining standard options to the corresponding pop-up menu.
 е Renamed some of the commands on the Formulas submenu.
 е Totally reorganized the Arrows submenu.  With the menu down, 
   press any modifier key to see the double arrow commands.
 е Shortened the Greek submenu considerably.  With the menu down, 
   press any modifier key to see the upper-case Greek letters.
 е The Greek letters have a new set of key bindings.  See the description 
   of the new Greek submenu below.
 е Added 'removeAuxiliaryFiles' to the LaTeX Utilities submenu, 
   which interactively removes all auxiliary files (.aux .bbl .dvi .glo 
   .idx .ind .lof .log .lot .toc .blg .clg .ilg .ps) for the current 
   document in the current directory.
 е Added 'deleteComments' to the LaTeX Utilities submenu.
 е Reorganized the Miscellaneous submenu.
 е Pete added a nifty keyboard-bound method of invoking any LaTeX menu 
   command.  It's called 'chooseCommand' (bound to <Opt Cmd T>) and it's 
   on the LaTeX Utilities submenu.
 е Vince Darley wrote a handy utility called 'insertReference' on the 
   LaTeX Utilities submenu that displays a list of labels defined in the 
   current document.  Choosing one of them inserts the corresponding \ref 
   at the insertion point.
   

	  	 	2.3

 е A handy install mechanism (designed and implemented by Tom Pollard) 
   lets the user choose between the old LaTeX macros (aka LaTeX 2.09) 
   and the current version (which is LaTeX 2e-compatible).  Simply choose 
   'install:LaTeX' on the Utils menu to switch versions.
 е Totally redesigned the kernel so that the insertion of LaTeX 
   environments and document templates is faster and less choppy.
 е The 'typeset' command is now bound to <Cmd T> (thanks, Pete!) and 
   supports version 2.2 of CMacTeX (courtesy of its author, Tom Kiffe)
   as well as DirectTeX running under MPW (Alun Carr <ajcarr@ccvax.ucd.ie> 
   provided the relevant code).  Alpha now supports all known Macintosh 
   TeX implementations!
 е A crude command completion mechanism has been implemented (see the 
   section on "Command Completion" at the bottom of this document).
 е The navigation commands 'bibtex' and 'makeindex' are now on the 
   Goto submenu (compliments of Tom Pollard).
 е Added \textnormal to the Text Style submenu.  It has no corresponding 
   command key, by default.
 е Added 'flushleft' and 'flushright' commands to the Environments 
   submenu on either side of 'center'.
 е Added a new Utilities submenu.  There's a procedure called 'clearTabStops' 
   (bound to <Cmd Tab>) which removes all tab stops, and another proc called 
   'convertDollarSigns' which replaces all dollar signs with appropriate LaTeX 
   syntax (see the "MathModes" section of this document).  Both these commands 
   act on the current document or the current selection (if there is one).  
   Another command called 'loadSymbolPackage' carefully inserts the string 
   "\usepackage{latexsym}" into the current document (see p.42 of the _LaTeX_ 
   book).
 е Added 'smallskip', 'medskip', and 'bigskip' to the Spacing submenu.
 е Modified 'filecontents' on the Documents submenu so that the user is 
   presented with a standard file dialog for selecting the file to be 
   prepended to the current document.
 е Fixed a bug in "latexKeys.tcl" (reported by Christian Konrad 
   <Konrad@dax1.w7.ipp-garching.mpg.de>) that prevented Bib mode from 
   initializing TeX mode.
 е Both the figure and table environments now have optional arguments.
 е Added the flag 'promptNoisily' to the "flags" pop-up menu.
 е Listed many of the corresponding command keys in the "LaTeX Help" 
   file (i.e., this file).
 е Fixed a bug (reported by Jonathan Guyer <j-guyer@nwu.edu>) which
   caused some "latex.tcl" routines to inadvertently alter the search
   string (in the Find dialog).  A recent Alpha enhancement made this
   bug fix possible.


	  	 	2.2

 е Improved the messages throughout.  (These can be read from the status 
   bar at the bottom of your screen.)
 е Significantly enhanced the letter documentclass template.
 е The 'typeset' command (formerly called 'Latex') on the LaTeX menu not 
   only switches to the appropriate LaTeX app (Textures and OzTeX are 
   currently supported), but also TeXs the current document automatically, 
   with a single keystroke.  (Thanks to Tom Pollard for assistance.)
 е Interchanged the command keys assigned to 'eqnarray' and 'eqnarrayStar' 
   so that they parallel those assigned to 'displaymath' and 'equation'.  
   As a result, un-numbered equations begin with the <Shf Opt> modifier while 
   numbered equations begin with <Ctl Opt>.  Also, 'eqnarrayStar' comes before 
   'eqnarray' on the Math Environments submenu.
 е Changed the command keys for the 'slide', 'tabular', and 'thebibliography' 
   environments.  (These changes were needed to make way for new environments).  
   See the files "latex_commands.tex" and "latex_keys.tex" for a complete list 
   of command keys suitable for printing.
 е Changed "\documentstyle" to "\documentclass" in the document templates 
   to conform with LaTeX 2e syntax.  Added a generic "\usepackage" command to 
   each of the templates.
 е Added the \appendix declaration to the Sectioning submenu.
 е Reorganized the Text Style menu according to LaTeX 2e conventions.
   Changed "{\em }" to "\emph{}", "{\it }" to "\textit{}" and "{\sl }" 
   to "\textsl{}", and removed the italic correction on all three (which 
   LaTeX 2e now handles automatically).  Also changed "{\sc }" to "\textsc{}", 
   "{\bf }" to "\textbf{}", "{\rm }" to "\textrm{}", "{\sf }" to "\textsf{}", 
   and "{\tt }" to "\texttt{}".  Added \underline (which works in any mode), 
   as well as \textup and \textmd (the default shape and series, 
   respectively).  The latter two commands do not have assigned command 
   keys, by default.
 е Added four new math styles to the Math Style submenu:  "\mathrm", 
   "\mathbf", "\mathsf", and "\mathtt".  Changed the name of "\mit" to 
   "\mathit" and "\cal" to "\mathcal".  Relocated the Math Style submenu 
   higher up on the LaTeX menu.
 е Added support for the new "slides" documentclass, and the associated 
   environments "slide", "overlay", and "note".
 е Implemented the Functions submenu, a menu of 34 log-like functions.
 е Added omicron to the Greek submenu, for completeness.
 е Added many commands, too numerous to mention by name, to the Binary 
   Operations, Relations, Arrows, Symbols, and Large Operators submenus.
 е Some LaTeX 2e symbols require the input of a special symbol package.  
   In "latex.tcl", before such a symbol is inserted into the text, a macro 
   automatically checks to see if the required symbol package is loaded.  
   If not, the user may opt to have the program install it automatically.
 е Added a Page Layout submenu and macros to insert a title page and 
   abstract.  There is also a 'maketitle' command which inserts a template 
   into the current document and positions it automatically.  (Note:  The 
   "titlepage" style is often used in conjunction with \maketitle.  See the 
   'styles' command on the Documents submenu.)  Other page layout commands 
   have also been added.
 е Fine tuned the insertion macros so that input is less choppy.
 е Command names now mimic their LaTeX 2e counterparts as much as possible.
 е Streamlined the code underlying the Delimiters submenu.
 е Added a 'center' command to the Environments submenu.
 е By default, <Opt Cmd $> and <Shf Opt Cmd $> are respectively bound to 
   'latexMath' and 'latexDisplaymath' (previously, these keys were bound 
   to 'texMath' and 'texDisplaymath').  Users wanting to use the old-style 
   dollar signs to invoke math mode should set the flag 'useDollarSigns' to 
   true.
 е TeX mode now recognizes the suffixes .ltx, .dtx and .ins, in addition 
   to .tex and .sty.  (Note that the suffixes are case sensitive, however.)
 е Restored the <Opt 8> keystroke to its default Macintosh setting 
   (which necessitated moving \bullet to <Opt Cmd 8>).  Thus <Opt 8> 
   inserts a literal bullet into the .tex document.  Bullets may be used 
   in conjunction with the tab stop mechanism (<Tab> and <Shf Tab>), and 
   are great for setting "bookmarks", for example.
 е The <Tab> and <Shf Tab> keys now beep if a tab stop is not found.  This 
   can be turned off by setting the 'searchNoisily' flag to false.  (Note:  
   Other search operations in "latex.tcl" also beep; the 'searchNoisily' flag 
   applies to all of them simultaneously.)
 е Added a proc called 'nthTabStop' (bound to <Ctl Tab>) which generalizes 
   the existing 'nextTabStop' and 'prevTabStop' routines by taking an 
   arbitrary integer argument.
 е Added a new Goto submenu containing the various navigation commands  
   mentioned above.  Also included are commands for moving to and from the 
   next and previous (sub)sections.  (See the docs for the corresponding 
   command keys.)
 е Added more than ten commands to the Boxes submenu, including \fbox, 
   \sbox, \raisebox, \parbox, and \rule.  There's also a new minipage 
   environment.
 е Reorganized and enhanced the Spacing submenu with additional 
   commands, the first half-dozen of which are listed in increasing order 
   of "wideness".  Adjusted the corresponding command keys (all of which 
   are a modified spacebar) so that they more closely match the order of 
   the menu items.
 е To facilitate file transfer, LaTeX 2e now has a 'filecontents' 
   environment to contain the source of a LaTeX auxiliary file.
   This new environment is supported in "latex.tcl" 2.2 on the Documents 
   submenu.  Also on the Documents submenu are new commands for 
   automatically inserting standard LaTeX 2e styles and packages.
 е Implemented the International submenu, including most of the symbols 
   and half of the accents.
 е The \mathcal command on the Math Style submenu now checks to see that 
   its argument is upper-case.
 е Broke the "latex.tcl" source code into four parts:  "latex.tcl", 
   "latexMode.tcl", "latexMenu.tcl", and "latexKeys.tcl".
 е Fixed 'wordBreak' and 'wordBreakPreface' (thanks Pete!) so that the 
   leading backslash is now selected when double-clicking a LaTeX command.
 е The flags 'optionIsMeta' and 'useDollarSigns' (on the "flag" pop-up 
   menu) are now dynamic in the sense that they may be changed at any time 
   with immediate effect.
 е Environments which prompt the user for input (enumerate, itemize, 
   description, thebibliography, tabular, array, eqnarray, and eqnarray*) 
   now do so on the status bar at the bottom of the screen.


	  	 	2.0

 е The documentation (LaTeX Help and latex_commands.tex) has been totally 
   rewritten.
 е A new, expanded LaTeX menu has been implemented, following closely the 
   organization and terminology of the LaTeX book.
 е Ellipses have been added to LaTeX menu items where appropriate.
 е Macros intelligently respond to the current selection---although
   many objects simply replace the current selection (similar to Paste), 
   others conveniently and automatically wrap themselves around it.  
   Environments automatically wrap themselves around a selection, too.
 е Functionality has been localized in utility macros as much as possible.
 е Standard document types (letter, article, report, and book) have been 
   added.  Simply select some text (or not) before choosing the desired 
   command from the Documents menu.
 е Three flags have been added to the Utils menu:  'useBoxMacro' (which 
   controls the behavior of the figure environment), 'deleteObjectNoisily' 
   (which controls an alert that appears when the current selection is 
   about to be replaced by an object), and 'deleteEnvironmentNoisily' 
   (which controls an alert that appears when the current selection is 
   about to be replaced by an environment).
 е Many new environments have been added (figure, table, verbatim, quote,
   quotation, verse) and some (enumerate, itemize, description, tabular, 
   bibliography, array, eqnarray, and eqnarray*) now prompt the user for 
   the desired number of rows and, in some cases, columns.  The environment 
   body is then constructed automatically.
 е The figure environment now depends on a flag called 'useBoxMacro' on the
   Utils menu.  If this flag is true (which it is by default), then the
   figure environment inserts the string "\\centerline{\\$boxMacroName{е}}"
   into its body.  Otherwise, the body of the figure environment is left
   empty (unless there is a current selection, in which case the figure
   environment wraps).
 е A new, improved fraction macro now parses a selection of the form 
   "numerator/denominator" and then automatically constructs the 
   corresponding displayed fraction.  A selection not containing a  
   "/" is inserted in lieu of the fraction's numerator.
 е Both TeX and LaTeX math modes are supported, including $...$, $$...$$,
   \(...\), and \[...\].  These are inserted into the document horizontal-
   ly.  The corresponding multi-line environments \begin{math}...\end{math} 
   and \begin{displaymath}...\end{displaymath} are also supported and 
   heartily recommended (since these constructs are more easily modified 
   and maintained by the user).
 е There's now a two-parameter nth root, in addition to square root.
 е Arbitrary one- and two-parameter LaTeX commands have been implemented, 
   namely, \<command>{е} and \<command>{е}{е}.  These can be run inter-
   actively, or used as templates for user-defined commands.
 е In addition to sum and integral, numerous "large operators" (product, 
   union, intersection, logical and/or) have been added.
 е The nonumber command has been removed since it only appears in the 
   context of an eqnarray environment.
 е Both the Conjugate and Expected Value commands have been removed since 
   in my (perhaps limited) experience these are nonstandard mathematical 
   notation.
 е Sectioning commands no longer insert a trailing carriage return.
 е The Sum and Integral commands no longer typeset the current selection 
   as the lower limit of the sum or integral.
 е The command texDisplayEqn is no longer supported. Instead, the commands
   MathModes:texDisplaymath and MathModes:latexDisplaymath insert 
   themselves horizontally into the .tex file.  For vertical source code 
   formatting, use MathEnvironments:Displaymath.
 е Extraneous comments preceding each environment have been removed.
 е The command alignEqual has been removed since the separator is now
   inserted automatically into the appropriate environments.


	  	 	1.2

 е **IMPORTANT**: KEYBINDINGS NOW DEPENDENT ON optionIsMeta FLAG

 е macros shortened through use of movePoint and selReplace utility macros.
 е new macros added: section, subsection, subsubsection, enumerate,
   itemize
 е most short macros handle selected text (i.e. highlight "word", execute
   the boldface command, and you get "{\bf word}").  NOTE: this is 
   OPTIONAL--you can still execute boldface, type "word", and type tab.
 е latex key bindings only performed the first time Tex mode is entered,
   to save time
 е emphasize macro updated


	  	 	1.1

 е non-breaking space removed from cite macro
 е slide environment macro added and assigned to o-F9 and c-o-9
 е equation, displaymath, eqnarray, eqnarray*, slide, and general environment
   now indent and no longer insert a blank line if called from column 0.
 е texDisplayEqn ($$...$$) added and bound to o-s-4
