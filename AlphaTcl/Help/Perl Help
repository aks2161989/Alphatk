	  	Introduction


The Perl menu was written to allow Alpha to act as a front end for Matthias
Neeracher's standalone MacPerl application and to make it possible to "attach"
Perl scripts to Alpha.  It provides a number of features designed to make the
use and development of Perl scripts on the Mac more convenient.  These are
detailed in the rest of this document (most easily navigated using the "M"
menu on the sidebar), but here's a quick overview:

	Editing Perl scripts...

• Perl keywords and special variables are colorized in Perl mode.

• The Perl 4 man page is provided as an on-line reference, 
  available as the file "Perl Commands" in Alpha's Help menu; it has 
  been colorized and indexed to make it easy to read and navigate.

• The man page can be referenced by command-double-clicking a 
  highlighted Perl keyword or special variable in your Perl script.
  
• Source files mentioned in require statements can be opened by 
  command-double-clicking as well. 
 
	Running Perl Scripts...

• Perl scripts can be run directly from Alpha - a script can be a text
  window in Alpha, a highlighted selection from a window, or a disk file.

• You can save scripts as MacPerl droplets and runtime applications 
  directly from Alpha.

• Perl scripts that read from standard input and write to standard 
  output may be used to process text in Alpha's text windows.

	Debugging Perl scripts...

• When a script fails, the error messages are displayed and the 
  script is brought up with the line that caused the error highlighted.

• A Perl mode preference can be set to cause scripts to run under the Perl 
  debugger (without modifying the script).


Instructions for obtaining the "# MacPerl Application" are given below. 

For more general information about Perl, go to <http://www.perl.com/>.


	  	Installation


No special installation procedure is required before using this package.
However, there are a couple of things that you may want to do to configure
things for your particular machine.


	  	 	Perl application and library

Alpha needs to know where to find your local Perl application in order to
interact with it, and will automatically prompt you to locate it if it doesn't
know where it is.  You can always check and/or change the path that Alpha uses
by selecting the "Perl Sig" preference, available by selecting the menu item
"Config > Mode Prefs > Preferences" (while in Perl mode).

Preferences: Mode-Perl

When opening "require"d source files via the Command-Double-Click mechanism,
Alpha will always look in the "lib" folder in the local Perl application
directory.  To have Alpha look for library files elsewhere, you can specify an
additional personal library folder, using the "Perl Lib Folder" preference in
Mode Prefs dialog.  You can also specify Perl mode search paths using the
package: searchPaths -- see the section on "# Text Filters" below.


	  	 	Text Filters Setup

The Perl menu contains a hierarchical submenu of preattached scripts to be
used as text filters.  A sample collection of such scripts is distributed with
Alpha in the ":Tcl:UserCode:Text Filters:" folder.  You can specify your own
folder of scripts using "Perl Lib Folder" preference in the Mode Prefs dialog.

If you want to use Perl scripts to process Alpha text buffers (see Text
Filters), you'll need to arrange that the Perl menu is a global feature.  Use
the "Config > Global Setup > Menus" dialog to do so.  Or, you could make the
Perl menu a mode specific feature for Text (or any other) mode.

Preferences: Menus

	  	 	Perl Preferences

There are a handful of flags you can set to modify the way Alpha and your
local Perl application interact while running Perl scripts.  These can be set
from either the Perl menu or the Mode Prefs dialog.  They're described in more
detail below in the "# Perl Menu" section.

	  	
	======================================================================


	  	Perl Mode


Perl mode is entered automatically whenever you open a file with a ".pl" or
".ph" suffix; you can also invoke it explicitly using the modes menu in the
status bar.  A "Perl Example.pl" syntax file is available for exploring some
of the mode's features and the Perl menu.

Perl mode offers a number of features supporting the editting and debugging of
Perl scripts:


	  	 	Basic language support


• Perl keywords and special variables appear in blue in Perl mode.

• A single line or a selected block of lines may be commented out by 
  using the "Comment Line" command under the "Text" menu.  Lines
  are uncommented using "Uncomment Line", which appears in the "Text" 
  menu when the option key is held down.

• Alpha will create an index of all subroutines in your Perl script when 
  you select "Mark File" from the Marks menu on the sidebar (the "{}" 
  button).  Once created this index is saved with your file.  

  When you open a Perl script that hasn't already been marked, an index 
  is automatically created if the "Auto Mark" preference is set.


	  	 	Command-Double-Clicking


A simple form of hypertext help is invoked by Double-Clicking on certain
pieces of text while pressing the Command modifier:

• The online man page can be referenced by Command-Double-Clicking a 
  highlighted Perl keyword or special variable in your Perl script.
  
  Most of the clickable keywords and variables will be colored blue.
  Special variables containing alphabetic characters, .e.g. @ARGV,
  are also clickable but are not colored.

  If you are using Perl 5, you probably want to download an additional set
  of help files from here:

      <ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/pub/alpha/Perl_5_Docs.sit.hqx>

  After you have unpacked the archive, use the Mode Prefs dialog to locate 
  the folder so that command double-clicking will know where to find it. 
  If the "Click Searches On-line" preference is set, then a manual page url
  will be sent to your local browser instead.
  
• Command-double-clicking on the name of the source file in a require
  statement will cause that file to be opened by Alpha.  

  Alpha will look for the file in the current script's folder, in your local
  library folder, in the local Perl application's lib folder, and in any
  folder set as a Perl mode search path (in that order).  The local lib
  folder may be specified interactively by the user using the Mode Prefs
  dialog (see the section on "# Installation" below).
 

	  	 	Mode Preferences


A more complete set of Perl option flags are also settable through the menu
item "Config > Mode Prefs > Preferences " menu item (while you're in Perl
mode).  Most of these are explained below in the "# Perl Mode Options" section
below, but one additional 'variable' preferences is also available:

	Perl Cmdline Args 	

Contains the last command-line options supplied.

Note that these are only passed to scripts when the "Prompt for Args" option
is active.

	  	
	======================================================================

	  	Perl Menu


Alpha's Perl menu allows a number of actions that include interaction with a
local Perl application, or aids to write Perl scripts.  These include ...


	  	 	Perl Interaction


	Swith to Perl  				

Switch to the local Perl application.


	  	 	Tell Perl ...

	
	Open This File		

Open the current document in the local Perl application.
	
	Save As Droplet		

Save the current document as a MacPerl droplet.
	
	Save As Droplet		

Save the current document as a MacPerl runtime script.
	
	Save As CGI			

Save the current document as a MacPerl CGI applet.
	
(A bug in the AEGizmos package makes it impossible to create CGI applets
directly from Alpha at this point.  You will have to open the script in
MacPerl and save it from there.)
	
	Open Output Window 	

Retrieve the contents of MacPerl's main output window into a new window
under Alpha.
	
	Close Output Window	

Close MacPerl's main output and debugger windows.
	
	Quit  				

Force the local Perl application to quit. 


	  	 	Quick Save As ...

Save the current window as a Droplet, Runtime, or a CGI file.

	  	 	Perl Help

	Perl Home Page

Sends the "Perl Home Page" url preference to your local browser.

	Perl Mode Help

Opens this file.

	MacPerl Help

Opens the "MacPerl Help" help file.

	Perl 4 Manual

Opens the "Perl Commands" help file.

	Perl 5 Manual (local)

Opens the 'perl' file located in the Perl 5 Help Docs folder.  This folder is
not distributed with Alpha, but can be easily downloaded from here:

    <ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/pub/alpha/Perl_5_Docs.sit.hqx>

Once you have unpacked the archive, set the "Perl 5 Help Docs Folder"
preference so that Alpha will know where to look for it.

	Perl 5 Manual (www)

Sends the Perl Help url preference to your local browser.

	Local Command Help

Opens a dialog asking for a command for which you would like a manual page.
If the Perl Version preference is set to '4', then this command will be looked
up in the "Perl Commands" help file.  Otherwise, the command will be looked up
in the Perl 5 Help Docs folder if that is available.

	WWW Command Help

Opens a dialog asking for a command for which you would like a manual page.
If an on-line manual page exists, the url for it will be sent to your local
browser.


	  	 	Running Perl Scripts


	Run The Selection  	

Execute the selected text as a Perl script.

	Run The Buffer  	

Execute the current text window as a Perl script.

	Save And Run  		

Save the current window and run the saved file as a Perl script.

	Run A File  		

Run a selected disk file as a Perl script.  


	  	 	Applying Text Filter Scripts


	Select File As Filter	

Select a file to use as the text filter script.

	Select Buffer As Filter	

Select one of the open text windows to use as the text filter script.

	Repeat Last Filter		

Run again the last filter that was used.

If the contents of the file or buffer has changed, the new script is run.

	Perl Text Filters

This is a hierarchical menu of "preattached" scripts to use as text filters.
When a script is selected from this menu, it is immediately applied to the
current text window.

The menu is built from the contents of a user-selected folder.  The folder is
chosen using the "Perl Text Filters Folder" preference in the Mode Prefs
dialog.  The default location is a set of filters included with the AlphaTcl
library.
			
Additional submenus containing scripts in user-defined folders can also be
added to the main Perl menu.  See the section on "# Perl Filter Menus" below
for more information.


	  	 	Perl Filter Options

Flags controlling the behavior of text filters mechanism.
				
	Apply To Buffer		

Apply the filter to the entire current text window; otherwise, only the
selected text is used.
					
	Overwrite Selection	

When checked, the output from the text filter script will replace the input
text in the original window.  Otherwise, the output is written into a new
window.

	Run Without Confirmation

By default, you will be prompted to continue whenever you select a script to
be run.  To bypass this dialog, check this preference.
	
	Include Local Lib Menu

Include an additional Perl Filters submenu, based upon scripts found in the
folder specified by the "Perl Lib Folder" preference.  See the section below
on "# Perl Filter Menus" for more information.

	Include Perl Path Menu

Include an additional Perl Filters submenu, based upon scripts found in the
folders specified by the "Perl Search Paths" preference.  Selecting this menu
item will add additional Filter Options menu items for manipulating Perl mode
search paths.  See the section below on "# Perl Filter Menus" for more
information.

	Rebuild Filter Menu  

Reconstruct the "Perl Filters" menu(s) based upon the various preferences.
Shouldn't be necessary, since changing the preferences will usually
automatically rebuild these menus.


	  	 	Perl Mode Options

	
This menus allows you to change the values of various "flag" preferences
that control Alpha's behavior when executing ordinary scripts (not text
filters).

 	
	Auto Switch			

Switch to MacPerl while scripts are being executed.  Otherwise, Alpha remains
frontmost until the script finishes.

	Prompt For Args		

Have Alpha prompt you for command-line arguments to be passed to the script.

	Retrieve Output		

Automatically retrieve any output written to the MacPerl output window and
display it in a new window under Alpha.

If the mode variable "Recycle Output" is set, the previous output window is
overwritten.
 						
	Use Debugger 		

Force the script to run under the MacPerl debugger.

Control is automatically switched to MacPerl when the debugger is used.

	Click Searches On-line

When command double-clicking, try to open an on-line manual page for a command
if one exists.

	Structural Marks

To recognize strings embedded in 

#### some text ####

as section dividers, turn this preference on.  Note that if 'some text' is
just a string of dashes, as in

#### ---- ####

an actual divider will be placed in the Marks menu.  If this preference is not
turned on, then all marks will be presented alphabetically, similar to using
the {} 'Parse Funcs' item.


	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Collect Identifiers

Searches the current window to find any string starting with $ @ % or *, and
any string embedded in <>.  Results are put into the OS clipboard.

This is useful when you want to check for spelling mistakes in identifiers
(can be used with "cannonize").  Also, provides a handy way to make all the
identifiers available to another file so you can use the completion /
expansion routines.  Just paste them in whatever file you like.

	Regular Expression Colors

Alters the coloring scheme of Perl mode to better visually parse regular
expressions.  (The 'string' and comment colors are set to 'none', and any
special symbols such as * or \ are colored red.)

	Default Colors

Restores the default colors for Perl mode.


	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	  	 	Perl Insertions

This submenu contains a few useful items for editing Perl scripts.

	Add Remove @

Either adds @ to or removes @ from the beginning of the word in which the
cursor currently resides.

	Add Remove $

Either adds $ to or removes $ from the beginning of the word in which the
cursor currently resides.

	Insert Divider

Adds this text:

##### | #####

at the beginning of the current line.  This string is recognized as a special
type of file mark.

	New Comment

Inserts a 'paragraph-style' comment at the beginning of the current command,
as determined by indentation.

	Edit Comment

Allows the comment inserted by the 'New Comment' menu item to be customized.
Simply type a template for a new comment, highlight, and then select this menu
item.  To enter • template stops (known as bullets), press "Option-8" -- be
sure to include TWO bullets for every stop.


	  	 	Perl Navigation

Navigation in Perl mode is determined by indentation.  The start of any
command is indicated by a non-comment character in column 1 of any row.  The
command continues until the next non-comment character appears in col 1.

	Next Command

Advance the cursor to the next command.  If any text is highlighted, the
selection will be extended to the next command.  Also bound to the arrow keys
when 'control' and 'shift' are pressed at the same time.

	Prev Command

Back up the cursor to the previous command.  If any text is highlighted, the
selection will be extended to the start of the previous command.  Also bound
to the arrow keys when 'control' and 'shift' are pressed at the same time.

	Select Command

Highlight the entire command in which the cursor currently resides.

	Reformat Command

Select the entire command (if there is no current selection), and properly
indent it.  At the end of this procedure the cursor is advanced to the next
command.

	  	
	======================================================================


	  	Running Scripts


Running scripts using the MacPerl menu is pretty straightforward.  You can
send the current selection, the entire current buffer, or a disk file to
MacPerl for execution as a Perl script; the result will be the same as if you
ran the script from MacPerl itself.  Here are listed some important points to
remember when running Perl scripts using the MacPerl menu.

	  	 	Input and Output


• Except for text filter scripts, the standard input for your script 
  is taken from the keyboard (while MacPerl is in the foreground) and
  standard output goes to MacPerl's output window.
    
  If you need to interact with the script while it's running, make sure
  that you've selected the "Auto Switch" flag under "Perl Mode Options".

• To get the output from your script, select the "Retrieve Output" 
  flag under "Perl Mode Options", this will cause Alpha to copy any output to
  Macperl's standard output window back into Alpha after your script has
  completed.  You can always do this manually by using the "Get Output
  Window" command under the "Tell Macperl…" submenu.
    
  Again, if you need to see the results while the script is running, use
  AutoSwitch" to bring MacPerl to the foreground during script execution.

	  	 	Current Directory


For the purpose of resolving relative file references, etc., within your
script, it's important to understand how the current directory of the running
script (as returned by `pwd` ) is determined.

• If you run a script file (using "Run A File"), then the folder containing
  that file is the current folder.

• If you run a script from a text buffer (using "Run The Buffer" or "Run 
  The Selection") , it is as though you ran it directly from a window in
  the local Perl application, and so the current directory your script sees
  is the local Perl application folder.
    
• If you run a script from a buffer using the "Save and Run" command, 
  then the script is first saved to disk and then executed as a script
  file.  In this case, the current directory is that of the script file.


	  	 	Command-line Args


• If the menu flag "Prompt For Args" is checked, then the user is prompted 
  for command-line arguments at the time the script is run.  These will be 
  available inside the script through the @ARGV array, as usual.  They are 
  also saved in the Perl-mode variable "Perl Cmdline Args", and become the 
  default arguments the next time the script is executed.

	  	 	Error Messages


• If the script fails for some reason, Alpha will read the error messages 
  returned by MacPerl and write them back into a new text window, called 
  "* Perl Errors *".  

• The script that generated the error is brought up and the first line 
  specifically referenced in an error message is highlighted.

  Note that error-trapping remains active whether "Retrieve Output" is set 
  or not.


	  	 	Interrupting a Script


When you run a Perl script from Alpha, Alpha will display the watch cursor and
wait for the reply from Macperl before doing anything else.  There may be
times when this is inappropriate, for instance, if you expect the script to
run for a long time or if you think the script is misbehaving for some reason.

• You can always tell Alpha to stop waiting for a script to finish by 
  hitting "Cmd-.".  
  
  This does not abort the script itself; to do that you'll have to switch 
  over to MacPerl to terminate the script there, as well.

• When you interrupt a script in this way, Alpha will no longer 
  automatically get the output or error messages from MacPerl, when and if 
  the script does finally terminate.
  
  You can always retrieve the contents of the output window yourself using
  "Get Output Window" from the "Tell Perl" submenu or simply by switching
  over to MacPerl itself.

There are some simple causes for a hung script.  For instance, if MacPerl is
configured to check for "#!"  lines in scripts and yours doesn't have one, it
will put up a dialog asking whether or not to procede.  If you didn't switch
over to MacPerl when the script was run, you have know way of knowing this,
and so you and Alpha may end up just sitting there waiting.


	  	Text Filters


Perl is, among other things, a powerful tool for extracting and rewriting data
from text files.  On a Unix system, one would typically write text-processing
scripts to read from "standard input" and write to "standard output", taking
advantage of command-line i/o redirection to specify the actual input and
output files used at any given time.  On the Mac, the typical absence of a
command-line interface makes it harder to use this elegant method.

The MacPerl menu in Alpha makes it possible to use scripts that read from
standard input and write to standard output to process text buffers in Alpha
directly.  Any text window can be used as standard input and standard output
can either be directed back to that same window or to a newly created one.
The script used may either be a disk file or yet another Alpha text window.


	  	 	Applying a Text Filter 


The procedure for using Perl text filters in Alpha is simple:

1. Bring the text window you want to operate on to the front and select 
   (highlight) the text that will be the input to the script.
   
 • If the "Apply To Buffer" option is selected, then the entire text 
   window will be used as input and any text selection is ignored.
   
 • Only complete lines are used as input.  The text used will be extended 
   to include all of the lines on which the selected text lies.

2. Select a Perl script using one of the commands, "Select Buffer As 
   Filter", "Select File As Filter" or "Repeat Last Filter" from the Perl 
   menu, or by choosing one of the scripts listed in the "Text Filters" 
   submenu.

 • You can see the name of the last script used by examining the 
   variable "Perl Last Filter" in the Mode Prefs dialog. This
   is the script that will be used if you use "Repeat Last Filter" 
     
 • If the "Prompt For Args" option has been selected, you'll be given 
   a dialog box to type in the command-line arguments for the script. 

3. The output of the script is written back out, either in the place of 
   the input text (if the "Overwrite Selection" option is selected) or into 
   a new text window.
        
 • As always, Alpha's unlimited undo capability let's you recover if you 
   accidently overwrite the input text when you didn't want to.
    
 • If the script halts on an error, the filter operation is aborted 
   and any error messages are displayed in a new window.


The ability to take the script itself from a text window allows simple
one-time scripts to be created and applied on the fly.  This can be very
useful because, even with the overhead to start up MacPerl, large-scale global
search-and-replace operations (hundreds of replaces) can be substantially
faster in MacPerl than in Alpha.  Also, you might find it easier to apply a
series of regular expression substitutions using a single, short Perl script,
rather than a number of separate "Find" and "Replace All" commands in Alpha.


	  	 	Perl Scripts Menus


Frequently used text filter scripts can be conveniently accessed in one of
several ways, each of which has a "Perl Filters/Scripts" menu associated with
it.  When the Perl menu is first created, it looks in various folders and
builds a hierarchical submenu from the names of the scripts that it finds.  If
the "Run Without Prompting" preference is set, selecting any of these scripts
will IMMEDIATELY run them, without any explicit prompting, so please use the
items with care if you are not familiar with the script being called.

(Tip: holding down any modifier key while selecting the menu item will open
the script in Alpha for previewing or editing.)


	Perl Text Filters

The first collection is a sampling of very useful :-) Perl scripts distributed
with Alpha in the folder ":Tcl:UserCode:Text Filters".  The "Perl Text
Filters" submenu contains all of these scripts -- selecting any of them will
automatically run the script in the local Perl application.

The "Text Munging" scripts in this collection ("shuffle", "sort lines",
"travesty", and "wordcount") were taken from the Camel book (Programming
Perl).

The "s2p" script is Tom Pollard's adaptation of the standard code that
converts Unix "sed" scripts to Perl (it was modified to work without using the
C preprocessor.)

"Strip Mail Headers" takes e-mail files and edits out any header lines but the
few that one would typically care about ("From:, "Date:", etc..).

"CC To BibTeX" is a script Tom uses that takes listings from the online
"Current Contents" database and rewrites them as BibTeX database entries.  To
try it out, select (highlight) the sample Current Contents citation below and
choose "CC To BibTeX" from the "Text Filters" submenu (make sure that "Apply
To Buffer" is _not_ checked before you do!)

	Perl Lib Scripts

The second collection is associated with the preference named "Perl Lib
Folder".  Use the Mode Prefs dialog to set or change this preference.  To
include this menu, you must check the "Include Lib Filters Menu" preference,
available as a toggleable item in the "Perl Filters Options" menu.  Unlike the
"Perl Text Filters" menu, only files with the Perl mode file extensions (as
determined by Alpha's <<suffixMappings>>) will be included in the menu.

Note: if any of the folders in this preference are named 'File', 'Edit',
'Text' or 'Search' then these menus in the menu bar will be over-written !!
Please check to make sure this is not the case before adding the Perl Lib
Scripts menu.

	Perl Path Scripts

The third location for scripts can contain multiple folders associated with
Perl mode using the package: searchPaths.  Note that it is not necessary to
activate the "Search Paths" feature in order to create such a menu, simply
check the "Include Path Filters Menu" preference, available as a toggleable
item in the "Perl Filters Options" menu.

Once the menu has been included, use the "Perl Filter Options > Paths" menu
items to view, add, or remove Perl mode search paths.  Note that the frontmost
window must be in Perl mode in order to set these paths.  Unlike the "Perl
Text Filters" menu, only files with the Perl mode file extensions (as
determined by Alpha's <<suffixMappings>>) will be included in the menu.

Note: if any of the folders in this preference are named 'File', 'Edit',
'Text' or 'Search' then these menus in the menu bar will be over-written !!
Please check to make sure this is not the case before adding the Perl Path
Scripts menu.


	  	MacPerl Application


MacPerl was written (ported to the Mac) by

          Matthias Neeracher <neeri@iis.ee.ethz.ch>, and 
          Tim Endres <time@ice.com>.

If you don't already have MacPerl, it's available following the links found at
<http://www.macperl.com/>.

See also Alpha's "MacPerl Help" file for more information about the
differences between MacPerl and a typical Unix perl implementation
       
For more general information about Perl, go to <http://www.perl.com/>.


	  	Bugs, etc.


Comments and suggestions regarding this package are always welcome.  If
there's something that bothers you, or some additional capability that you'd
like to see, let us know and we'll see what we can do.

Bug reports and any other comments should be directed to the AlphaTcl
developers (or users) mailing list.  See the file "Readme" for details.
