1. Introduction

The 'manipCols' package is a feature which    allows    to    do    various
manipulations with the columns of any tabulated material i-e  a  series  of
lines in which items are separated by a tabulation or by any other specific
character (like & or a tabulation or a colon, a comma, an  endash  etc.  or
even the space character). Once it is installed and activated,  it  adds  a
submenu called Columns to the Text menu in Alpha.  The  items  of  this
submenu are explained below. Basic manipulations  are  copying,  inserting,
appending, twiddling,  deleting,  sorting,  numbering  and  (un/)equalizing
columns, formating text in columns.

2. Installation

2.1. Automatic installation
Open the "OPEN TO INSTALL" file. Opening this file indicates to Alpha  that
a new package has to be installed  :  the  procedure  is  automatic.  Alpha
knows where to store the different elements of your manipCols package.

2.2. Manual installation


   1. put the "manipCols.tcl" file in the "Packages" subfolder  of  the  "Tcl"
folder which is located at the same level as your Alpha application

   2. put the "ManipCols Help" file in the "Help" folder located at  the  same
level  as your Alpha application. Next time you launch Alpha, you will have
a "ManipCols Help" item in the Help menu.

   3. launch Alpha. You have to  rebuild  the  package  indices  and  the  Tcl
indices. Rebuild Package Indices is in  the  Config-Packages  menu,  and
Rebuild Tcl Indices is in the Tcl menu.

   4. quit Alpha and relaunch it : that's all there is to it.

2.3. Activating the manipCols feature
Go to "Config->Global Setup->Features" and select  'Manip  Cols'
in the features list by checking the corresponding checkbox.

2.4. After installing
Have a look at the Manip Cols preferences in the Packages submenu of  the
Config menu. More explanations below.

3. Basics

3.1. Columns selection
to select one or several columns, put the cursor anywhere in  the  text  of
the top left item (or "cell") you want to select, press  the  mouse  button
and,  without releasing the button, go to the text of the bottom right item
you want to select.
This will hilite a region which is much more than what  you  want  but  the
package will consider only the columns located between the top  and  bottom
positions.
Here is an example (from Romeo and Juliet). We suppose here that each  word
is separated by a tabulation (any single  character  can  be  chosen  as  a
separator, even the space character; see below) :
Gallop  apace,   you      fiery-footed steeds, 
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such         a       waggoner     
As      Phaethon would    whip         you     to           the west, 
And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

Put the cursor in the word 'you' (first row, third word), press  the  mouse
button and, without releasing it, go to the word 'whip' in the  third  row,
then release : you have selected the following region
you	fiery-footed
lodging;	such
would	whip

even though all the words from 'you' to 'whip' are hilited.  We  have  thus
selected columns 3-4 and rows 1-3.
It is sometimes difficult to be sure what has been selected because columns
are not aligned vertically so  you  can  check  this  using  the  Colorize
Columns menu item : only the selected columns will be colorized like so
Gallop  apace,   you      fiery-footed steeds, 
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such         a       waggoner     
As      Phaethon would    whip         you     to           the west, 
And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

So dragging the mouse from position (a,b) in a table to position (c,d) 
selects columns 'a' to 'c' and rows 'b' to 'd'.

If you want to have a better vertical alignment of your columns you can use
the Equalize Columns menu item. Select the region  as  above  and  select
Equalize Columns in the Columns menu. The result will be :
Gallop  apace,   you      fiery-footed steeds, 
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such         a       waggoner     
As      Phaethon would    whip         you     to           the west, 
And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

By the way, equalizing makes it very easy to  use  rectangular  hiliting  :
select a region with the mouse holding the option key down.


3.2. Columns separator
It must NECESSARILY be a SINGLE character. 
Default is the tabulation character \t. 
With Latex you might want to choose '&' as a separator for \array or \table
environments:

	     \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	 	\hline
	     you & fiery-footed \\
	     lodging; & such \\
	     would & whip \\
	 	\hline
	     \end{tabular}

You can even use the  'space'  character  as  a  separator.  See  also  the
Columns to Latex item below.

3.3. Caveat

• the cursor can be positioned anywhere in a "cell"  :  the  entire  column
will always be selected.
• you do not have necessarily to colorize the selected region. This is just
handy for visualisation. BEWARE  that  this  procedure  removes  all  other
colors in your document (this proc might be improved later).
• columns are numbered from 1 to n (see the messages in the status bar).
• hiliting must still be there if you want to  apply  a  manipulation  like
copying, inserting, appending, twiddling, deleting columns.
• note that (since version 0.5b) you DO NOT have anymore to escape (i-e put
a backslash before) the special characters like 'backslash' \ or 'dollar' $
or 'circumflex' ^ or 'endash'  -  etc.  The  package  takes  care  of  this
internally. The tabulation character though is represented by '\t'.
• all the actions are undoable (with cmd-Z).


3.4. Text columnizing
There are tools to format text in vertical justified  columns  (single
or multiple).  This  will  be  very  handy  to  prepare  nice  looking
documentations, help files, etc. All the  paragraphs  in  the  present
file have been justified with this tool. Everything is parametrizable:
number of columns, left margin, text width.
Here an example of multicolumnizing :
Gallop  apace,        you to the west, and bring in That runaways'  eyes  may 
fiery-footed      steeds, cloudy night immediately. wink, and Romeo  leap  to 
towards Phoebus' lodging; Spread thy close curtain, these arms,  untalk'd-of, 
such  a    waggoner    as love performing    night! and unseen !              
Phaethon would  whip  you 


3.5. More examples
You can now select a region and experiment : here are some examples applied
to the previous selection.

'Deleting'
Gallop  apace,   steeds,  
Towards Phoebus' a        waggoner     
As      Phaethon you      to           the     west,        
And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

'Copying, selecting the first two lines and appending'
Gallop  apace,   you      fiery-footed steeds, you          fiery-footed 
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such         a       waggoner     lodging;     such         
As      Phaethon would    whip         you     to           the          west,        
And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

'Copying, selecting the second column and inserting'
Gallop  you      fiery-footed apace,       you      fiery-footed steeds, 
Towards lodging; such         Phoebus'     lodging; such         a       waggoner     
As      would    whip         Phaethon     would    whip         you     to           the west, 
And     bring    in           cloudy       night    immediately. 

'Twiddling'
Gallop  apace,   fiery-footed you          steeds, 
Towards Phoebus' such         lodging;     a       waggoner     
As      Phaethon whip         would        you     to           the west, 
And     bring    in           cloudy       night   immediately. 

'Sorting Columns'
Gallop  apace,   lodging; such         steeds, 
Towards Phoebus' would    whip         a       waggoner     
As      Phaethon you      fiery-footed you     to           the west, 
And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

'Selecting the first two lines and reverse sorting rows'
you          steeds,  apace,       Gallop       fiery-footed 
waggoner     Towards  such         Phoebus'     lodging;     a            
As           Phaethon would        whip         you          to           the west, 
And          bring    in           cloudy       night        immediately. 

'Selecting all four lines and inserting rows numbers'
1 Gallop  apace,   you      fiery-footed steeds, 
2 Towards Phoebus' lodging; such         a       waggoner     
3 As      Phaethon would    whip         you     to           the west, 
4 And     bring    in       cloudy       night   immediately. 

etc. etc.



4. Menu Items

Almost all of these items suppose you have selected columns : see above 
how to select columns.
4.1. Main columns menu

<Copy Columns>
			Copy the selected columns in the MacOS system
			scrap.  Note  that  if  no  region  has  been
			selected or hilited,    the    entire    line
			containing the cursor will be copied.
<Insert Columns>
			Insert columns from the system  scrap  BEFORE
			the first selected column.
<Append Columns>
			Append columns contained in the system  scrap
			to the  right  of  the  selected  lines.  The
			procedure will append as much as it can :  if
			you have selected a  region  with  less  rows
			than the material  contained  in  the  system
			scrap, it will ignore the remaining lines.
<Cut Columns>
			Delete the selected columns and send  a  copy
			to the system  scrap  so  that  they  may  be
			pasted, inserted, appended elsewhere.
			All the columns to the right of the selection
			will be shifted left.
<Delete Columns>
			Delete the selected columns.
<Twiddle Columns>
			Exchange the leftmost and right most  columns
			of your selection. Note that  there  must  be
			enough elements on each    row    to    allow
			twiddling : if not the  procedure  will  fail
			and send  an  alert.  This  can  easily  been
			solved by using the Complete Rows item.
<Transpose Columns>
            Transpose columns and  rows.  All  rows  must
            have the same number of cells. The entire row
            is transposed  even  if  you  select  only  a
            portion.
<Colorize Columns>
			Colorize the selected items. This  is  useful
			to visualize a selected  region  and  control
			that it contains what you want.  Please  note
			that you will lose any colorization  you  did
			previously in your file. This point should be
			improved later. So use with care.


4.2. Columns formatting submenu

<Equalize Columns>
			This proc calculates the  maximum  length  of
			each of the selected columns and appends  the
			necessary amount of blank space so that  each
			column has a  unique  width.  This  allows  a
			perfect vertical alignment to make selections
			easier. Equalizing columns makes it very easy
			to use rectangular hiliting : select a region
			with the mouse holding the option key down.
<Unequalize Columns>
			This is the opposite of the previous items  :
			any blank space at the right of a "cell" will
			be trimed.
<Complete Rows>
			In case all the rows do  not  have  the  same
			"length" (i-e number    of    items),    this
			procedure will add empty   cells    to    the
			incomplete rows.
<Right Justify>
			To right justify the selected columns.
<Center>
			To center the selected columns.
<Left Justify >
			To left justify the selected columns.
<Insert Rows Numbers>
			Insert the number of the row at the beginning
			of the selected lines. Numbers are  separated
			by the current  separator  and  constitute  a
			separate column.
<Insert Numbers From...>
			The same as the previous except that you are
			prompted to choose the starting  number.  The
			last number reached in a  previous  numbering
			is proposed as a default choice.
<Columnize Text>
			To justify the selected text  :  it  is  left
			and right  justified    vertically    in    a
			rectangle. The values for the left margin and
			for the total text width can be set with  the
			Set Margins item. Default  values  in  Text
			mode are 5 and 75.
<Multi Columnize Text>
			To put text in multiple  columns  like  in  a
			newspaper. You are prompted in the status bar
			to choose  the  number  of  columns  (default
			value is 2).
<Uncolumnize Text>
			To  undo  the  previous  command  :  all  the
			columns of a table will be put one  over  the
			other in a single column.
			

4.3. Columns sorting submenu
			
<Sort Columns >

<Reverse Sort Columns     >

<Num Sort Columns>

<Reverse Num Sort Columns >
			This allows different  kinds  of  sorting  of
			columns in the selected region.  Sorting  can
			be done in increasing or decreasing order, in
			litteral (1 before 11 before 2) or  numerical
			order (1 before 2 before 11). Sorting is case
			insensitive. If several columns are  included
			in the selected region,  sorting  applies  to
			the left one.
<Sort Rows >

<Reverse Sort Rows     >

<Num Sort Rows >

<Reverse Num Sort Rows >
			This allows different  kinds  of  sorting  of
			each  entire  row  in  the  selected  region.
			Sorting can be done    in    increasing    or
			decreasing order, in litteral  (1  before  11
			before 2) or  numerical  order  (1  before  2
			before 11). Sorting is case insensitive.
			

4.4. Columns utilities submenu

<Set Margins>
			You will be prompted in  the  status  bar  to
			set the values for the left  margin  and  the
			total text width.
<Columns Separator>
			Change here the character    considered    as
			columns separator.  Remember  that  you  must
			choose a SINGLE character :if not, some procs
			might not work properly. It can be of  course
			the tabulation character represented  by  \t.
			This menu item allows to do temporary changes
			(as long as you do not quit Alpha). To change
			the Columns Separator permanently go  to  the
			manipCols Preferences.
<Columns Bindings>
			Brings a window with  information  about  the
			key bindings  available  when  the  manipCols
			package is active. See below.
<Columns Tutorial>
			Brings a window with a tutorial file.


5. Key Bindings

All the key bindings will use 'ctrl-c' (c for columns !) -- on Windows OS,
ctrl-d is used instead. 
Hit 'ctrl-c', release, then hit one of the following letters :
|________|______________________________________________________|
|ctrl-c a|to append columns                                     |
|ctrl-c b|to show info about bindings                           |

|ctrl-c z|to uncolumnize                                        |
|________|______________________________________________________|
If you use the 'More Cols' package (see  below),  you have four  more  key
bindings :
|________|_________________________________________________|
|ctrl-c h|to convert a table to html code                  |
|ctrl-c l|to convert a table to a latex tabular environment|
|________|_________________________________________________|


6. Preferences

The Manip Cols Prefs… item in the Packages submenu of the Config
menu allows you to make a few choices :

• the Columns Color variable allows you to choose the color in which
to colorize the selected columns.
• the Columns Separator variable allows you to  choose  the  default
character used to separate columns : this is the separator which  will
be used each time you launch Alpha and as long as you do not  override
this choice with the Columns Separator menu item.
• the Min Columns Width variable allows you to set the minimum width
allowed for columns when using the Text Columnizing tool.

8. More Cols Package

The 'More Cols' Package (moreCols.tcl) adds a few more  capacities  to
the 'Manip Cols' Package. It allows conversion of text tables  to  and
from Html or Latex formats. When it is activated, a new submenu called
Tables Conversion is added at the bottom of  the  Columns  menu.  It
contains the following items :


<Columns to Html	>
	Converts an ordinary text table to HTML  code
	to export to an Html document.
<Columns to Latex	>
	Converts an ordinary text table  to  a  LaTeX
	'tabular' environment.
<Columns to Html>
or
<Latex to Columns	>
	They convert an HTML table   or    a    Latex
	'tabular' (or 'array') environment    to    a
	simple text tabulated  with    the    current
	'columns separator'. Nested HTML  tables  are
	handled.


9. Known problems

9.1. Troubleshooting
If sometimes a proc does not do what you expect it to do, it is very  often
because you have changed the  columns  separator  and  still  think  it  is
another one. For instance if you change the separator from '\t' to a  blank
space ' ', any word will be considered in a different  column  whereas  two
words separated by a tab will be considered in the same  column.  And  vice
versa.
