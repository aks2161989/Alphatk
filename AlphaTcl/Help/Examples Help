	  	Introduction


This document describes the contents of the folder Examples, included as a
part of the Alpha distribution.  

<<file::showInFinder $HOME/Examples>>

This folder is not an essential component of the software.  Removing it,
however, will not reduce the memory requirements of the program, and will
only save disk space.  Note that in this file, as in most help files, 'Alpha'
refers to the family of programs that use the AlphaTcl library, including
Alpha 8/X and Alphatk.

Alpha is a mode-based text editor.  This means that its behavior can change
depending on the type of file that one has opened.  A LaTeX file, for example,
with a file suffix .tex, will induce Alpha to load special LaTeX menus,
colorize keywords, and adopt a particular indenting scheme.  Other modes are
specific to html files, or various programming / syntax languages.  Several
modes have been installed with their own Help files.

The links below open example files in a shell window which you can modify at
your leisure to explore a mode's schema for colorizing, file marking,
indenting, etc.  None of the changes you make will affect the actual file.  If
you close the window and then click on the hyperlink again, you will start
with the same example as before.  The examples are listed in 7 major sections:

"# LaTeX Modes"
"# HTML / WWW Modes"
"# Text Markup Modes"
"# Programming / Syntax Modes"
"# Science / Stat / Database Modes"
"# Alpha -- Specific Modes"
"# Feature Examples"

In this document, the examples in green are hyperlinks to examples for the
specified mode.  When you move your mouse over the link, the cursor will turn
into a magnifying glass, and clicking will load the proper mode and open up
the file.  Those in black are still waiting for a contribution -- if you have
a worthy example, the last section of this file contains an e-mail address for
making submissions.  Other hyperlinks refer to either help manuals installed
with Alpha, or www links.  If the Example file refers to a mode that is not
installed, Alpha will open it in 'Text' mode by default.

Some of the annotation comes from the University of Montana "Language Finger"
at <http://www.lib.umt.edu/guide/lang/langfing.htm> (UMLF).  Most of the rest
comes from program specific web sites.


	  	Determining Window Modes


Alpha determines the proper mode of a window/file in one of several ways.  The
file suffix of the window might be mapped to a particular mode -- see the
dialog <<suffixMappings>> for examples, or to change the suffix mappings
associated with given modes.  "Smart mode lines" that appear in the first line
of a file such as this:

	# -*-Tcl-*-

or this:

	* -*-Stta-*-

will take precedence over file suffixes if such a line exists, or unix style
application lines such as

	#!/bin/sh

or

	# /usr/stata

will be recognized and mapped to the mode which has internally declared itself
as the mode for such applications.  If Alpha cannot determine the proper mode
using these criteria, the default mode is 'Text'.  The mode of the current
window can also be changed manually using the 'Mode' pop-up menu found in the
status bar window, the box which currently reads 'Text'.  This menu lists all
of the modes currently recognized by Alpha.  This file is a special colorized
example of Text mode.

Many of Alpha's modes have been submitted by users, and are being continually
revised and updated.  The "Alpha Manual" contains more information on how
determine what packages you have available, as well as how to find and install
additional modes that might not be part of the "official" distribution.  The
file "Extending Alpha" explains how you could write additional modes, menus or
features yourself.  Although Alpha contains many modes that you might never
use, uninstalling them will not reduce the memory requirements of the program,
and will only save disk space.


	======================================================================


	  	LaTeX Modes


The LaTeX example below not only demonstrates Alpha's behavior for TeX mode,
it also serves as introduction to the markup language.


	  	 	LaTeX

TeX mode, for the family of TeX and LaTeX files.

(This includes .tex, .sty, .cls, .bst  etc.  files.)
                    
"LaTeX Example.tex"             "TeX Help"

This example is David R. Wilkins' Getting Started with LaTeX, a 45 page
introduction to Leslie Lamport's set of extensions to Donald Knuth's TeX
typesetting program.  This is a self-contained LaTeX file, which does not rely
upon any extra .sty files.  If one has already installed a LaTeX processing
software package, such as OzTeX or CMacTeX, one could process the actual file
contained in the Examples folder "LaTeX-Example.tex" (rather than the
hyperlink above) and obtain an excellent manual for LaTeX.


	  	 	BibTeX

Bib mode, for LaTeX bibliography files.

"BibTeX Example.bib"            "Bib Help"

This file is a compendium of books on computer languages and programming.

The Bib mode can also convert .bib files to .html or .refer (EndNote), and can
also convert some formats such as MARC or ISI to .bib, which is very
convenient.  You might not have to create a BibTeX entry from scratch ever
again!!  See "BibTeX Help" for details, or the package: bibConvert help.


	  	 	Metafont

Mf mode, to use Alpha as the front end for Metafont (with CMacTeX or OzTeX).

"Metafont Example.mf"           "Mf Help"

Metafont is the programming language written, as a companion to TeX, by Donald
Knuth in order to create characters, fonts, font families (and many others
things).  Metafont allows you to write the source files which TeX and Latex
will invoke at runtime to build the fonts they need: fonts are built according
to the desired size and to the resolution of your printer in order to get
printed documents with the highest typographic quality.

                                    -- <http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/>

	  	 	Metapost

Mp mode, to use Alpha as the front end for Metapost (with CMacTeX or OzTeX).  

"Metapost Example.mp"           "Mp Help"

Metapost is a programming language written by John Hobby in order to create
all kinds of figures, graphs, pictures to include in a document prepared with
TeX or with Troff.  Its syntax is very much like Metafont's syntax but
Metapost outputs are Postscript encapsulated files.

                                    -- <http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/>

	  	 	Omega

Omg mode, for (TeX) Omega syntax files.

"Omega Example.opl"             "Omg Help"

OMEGA is the program written, as a superstructure of TeX, by John Plaice and
Yannis Haralambous in order to extend TeX's capabilities and deal with any
possible language and script.  It is based internally on Unicode.

                                    -- <http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/>

Omg mode recognizes .tex, .opl, and .otp files.  Some of the mode's features
(such as file marking) are file extension dependent.  The example-hyperlink
will not have any such file extension -- for additional Omega examples, try
these links:

.tex    "Omega-Example.tex"
.opl    "Omega-Example.opl"
.otp    "Omega-Example.otp"


	  	 	PostScript

PS mode, for PostScript files.  This example is a PostScript version of the
first four pages of the Getting Started With LaTeX manual.  Alpha's PS mode is
also useful for seeing the internal contents of PDF files.

(Not specifically in the LaTeX family of modes, but it doesn't really fit well
in the other categories, either.)

"PostScript Example.ps"         "PS Help"

PostScript is a language, not a graphic file format.  A PostScript file is
really a program, not graphical data.  The difference is that by looking at a
PostScript file you (or an application) cannot easily tell what the file
represents.  Instead, you must run the file to see what it does.  Generally,
the result of running a PostScript program is to draw marks on a graphical
page.

                            -- <http://www.glyphic.com/free/macgs.html>


	======================================================================


	  	HTML / WWW Modes


The HTML example below not only demonstrates Alpha's behavior for HTML mode,
it also serves as an introduction to the markup language.


	  	 	HTML

HTML mode, for the family of World Wide Web html files.

(This includes .shtml, .css, .js files.)

"HTML Example.html"             "HTML Help"

HTML stands for HyperText Machine (or Markup) Language.  HTML is a subset of
SGML. It is a computer language used to create webpages.  A newer version now
exists, called Dynamic HTML, or DHTML. It allows precisely-controlled page
layout, animation, new interactivity and much more.

                                                        -- UMLF

This example is the NSCA's A Beginner's Guide to html, which sets forth the
required elements of a standard html web page, as well as additional tags that
one might use for stylistic or formatting purposes.  If one opened the actual
file in the Examples folder "HTML-Example.html" instead of the above
hyperlink, it could then be sent to the defined web browser.


	  	 	CSS

CSS mode, for (html) cascading style sheets.  

"CSS Example.css"               "CSS Help"


	  	 	JavaScript

JScr mode, for (html) javascript scripts.  

"JavaScript Example.js"         "JScr Help"

	  	
	  	 	PHP

PHP mode, for PHP-enabled web pages.

"PHP Example.php"              "PHP Help"

PHP is a tool that lets you create dynamic web pages.  PHP-enabled web pages
are treated just like regular HTML pages and you can create and edit them the
same way you normally create regular HTML pages.  PHP is a project of the
Apache Software Foundation.

                                            -- <http://www.php.net>

	  	 	Wiki
			
Wiki mode, for editing collaborative Wiki Wiki Web pages.

"Wiki Example"                 "Wiki Help"

The ideas of 'Wiki' may seem strange at first, but dive in and explore its
links.  'Wiki' is a composition system; it's a discussion medium; it's a
repository; it's a mail system; it's a tool for collaboration.  Really, we
don't know quite what it is, but it's a fun way of communicating
asynchronously across the network.

The name 'Wiki' may seem strange too - what does it mean?  The WikiWikiWebFaq
answers this and other questions, but the short answer is that Wiki Wiki is
Hawaiian for 'quick'.

                                            -- <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki>

Alpha's Wiki mode facilitates the editing of Wiki pages.  There are no 'Wiki'
file suffix mappings, so if you're cutting and pasting the contents of a wiki
editing text field from an internet browser window you have to open a new
window in Alpha and manually change the mode to Wiki.

Selecting an 'edit' hyperlink in a WWW rendering of a wiki page will open a
new window in Wiki mode, and allow you to post the edited content back to the
wiki source.  (See the WWW mode section below for more information about
viewing remote url files in Alpha.)  You can also create a list of 'favorite'
wiki pages using the Wiki menu, which are remembered between editing sessions.

AlphaTcl has a wiki page at <http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/wiki/>


	  	 	WWW

WWW mode -- a display mode for rendering web pages in Alpha.

"WWW Example"                   "WWW Help"

The WWW Menu allows you to render local HTML files directly in an Alpha text
window.  The hyperlinks in the WWW window can be navigated with the arrow
keys; the return key takes you to the target of the link if you have your
preferences set to do that.  All of Alpha8/X/tk support direct browsing of the
Internet.

If an internet connection is active (you'll be asked) this hyperlink will
fetch and render the home page for AlphaTcl.  Otherwise it will render the
first page of the HTML Mode Manual


	======================================================================


	  	Text Markup Modes


Alpha's Text mode is used by default when the mode of a window cannot be
determined via file extensions of 'smart mode lines'.  There are, however,
some additional modes which primarily support the markup of text (as opposed
to the creation of files specific to programming languages.)


	  	 	manuals

"man Example.n"                 "man Help"

This mode is for editing unix-style reference manuals, those which are
generally viewed using the 'man' command.  This example is the manual page for
Tcl, which describes the basic syntax of Tcl.


	  	 	Setext

Setx mode, for the Setext markup language.

"Setext Example.stx"			"Setx Help"

Setext stands for 'S'tructure 'E'nhanced 'Text'.  It is a markup scheme for
plain text documents such as email messages and e-zines.  Setext's primary
goal is to provide a way of marking text that is visually unobtrusive, so that
if you don't have a special setext browser, like EasyView, you can still read
the text.  -- Donavan Hall


	  	 	TIP

TIP mode, for Tcl Improvement Proposal suggestions.

"TIP Example.tip"                   "TIP Help"

This link will open a draft letter for a suggestion, and insert the TIP menu
into the menu bar.  See the <http://purl.org/tcl/tip/> TIP home page for more
information.


	  	 	Xml

xml mode, for eXtensible Markup Language documents

"xml Example.xml"                   "xml Help"

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format
derived from SGML (ISO 8879).  Originally designed to meet the challenges of
large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly
important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and
elsewhere.

                                        -- <http://www.w3.org/XML/>

This link will open a simple xml document.  If you are using Alphatk, you can
get an interactive tree view of the document with 'View Xml' in the xml menu.

Note that xml mode also creates two support modes -- 'dtd' and 'xsl'.  These
are used in the "Xml Menu > New Xml Doc" submenu.


	======================================================================


	  	Programming / Syntax Modes


Alpha is a very useful tool for editing a variety of computer language files.
If you can't find the language that you're looking for, please make a request
to one of the mailing lists described in the "Readme".


	  	 	Ada

Ada mode, for the Ada programming language.

"Ada Example.ada"               "Ada Help"

In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States Department of Defense was using more
than 2,000 languages for its mission-critical programming.  Most of these were
languages that were developed for one specific job.  Finally, in 1975, the DoD
formed the U.S. Department of Defense High-Order Language Working Group
(HOLWG) to find a solution to what was often called the "software crisis."

Rather than create this new language themselves, they decided to hold a
contest.  Coincidentally, all of the teams created Pascal-based languages.  In
the end, the winner was CII Honeywell-Bull in France.  Eventually, the
language was christened "Ada," in honor of Lady Ada Lovelace, daughter of
famed poet Lord Byron and assistant to mathematician Charles Babbage, who
invented the Analytical Machine.  Lady Ada is often considered to be the
world's first programmer.

By 1990, over 200 validated Ada compilers had been produced, and in 1995 a new
standard, called Ada 95, was announced.  Ada 95 is object-oriented, and offers
interfaces to the languages C, FORTRAN and COBOL.

                                        -- <http://www.adahome.com>

	  	 	AppleScript

Scrp mode, for AppleScript scripts.

"AppleScript Example.script"    "Scrp Help"

AppleScript is an English-like language used to write script files which can
control the actions of the computer and the applications which run on it.
Scripts can make decisions based on user-interaction or by parsing and
analyzing data, documents or situations.  Every Macintosh can be automated and
controlled using AppleScript which comes with and is an integral part of the
Macintosh operating system.

                                    -- <http://www.apple.com/applescript/>

	  	 	C

C mode, for the C programming language.

"C.Example.r"                   "C Help"

C was developed out of the construction of the UNIX operating system.  It has
a modular programming structure and is thus useful for functional programming.
Despite being a rather old language, it still seems to be used extensively for
much low-level development (other languages such as Tcl, Perl, Python are all
implemented in C).  C++ is largely a superset of C. Other dialects include
Small-C and Visual C.

                                                        -- UMLF

	  	 	C++

C++ mode, for the C++ programming language.

"C++ Example.cp"                 "C++ Help"

C++ was designed and implemented by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell
Laboratories to combine the organizational and design strengths of Simula with
C's facilities for systems programming.  The initial version of C++, called "C
with Classes," was first used in 1980; it supported traditional system
programming techniques and data abstraction.  The basic facilities for
object-oriented programming were added in 1983 and object-oriented design and
programming techniques were gradually introduced into the C++ community.  The
language was first made commercially available in 1985.  Facilities for
generic programming were added to the language in the 1987-1989 time frame.

As the result of widespread use and the appearance of several independently
developed C++ implementations, formal standardization of C++ started in 1990
under the auspices of the American National Standards Institute, ANSI, and
later the International Standards Organization, ISO, leading to an
international standard in 1998.  During the period of standardization the
standards committee acted as an important focus for the C++ community and its
draft standards acted as interim definitions of the language.

                                        -- <http://www.research.att.com/~bs/>

	  	 	C#

C# mode, for the C# programming language.

"C# Example.cs"                 "C# Help"

C# is a newish language from Microsoft, intended to compete with Java.

Microsoft C# (pronounced C sharp) is a new programming language designed for
building a wide range of enterprise applications that run on the .NET
Framework.  An evolution of Microsoft C and Microsoft C++, C# is simple,
modern, type safe, and object oriented.  C# code is compiled as managed code,
which means it benefits from the services of the common language runtime.
These services include language interoperability, garbage collection, enhanced
security, and improved versioning support.

C# is introduced as Visual C# in the Visual Studio .NET suite.  Support for
Visual C# includes project templates, designers, property pages, code wizards,
an object model, and other features of the development environment.  The
library for Visual C# programming is the .NET Framework.

	  	 	Caml

Caml mode, for the Caml programming language.

"Caml Example.ml"               "Caml Help"

ML is a computer language.  Originally designed by Robin Monet, Lockwood
Morris and Malcolm Newey in the early 1970's, it has undergone several
revisions, resulting 2 major and differing descendants now: CAML and Standard
ML.

                                                        -- UMLF

Caml is a programming language, easy to learn, easy to use, and yet amazingly
powerful.  It has been developed and distributed by INRIA (the main french
research institute for computer science), since 1984.  It is freely available
for Unix, PC or Macintosh.  There exist two flavors of Caml: Caml Light and
Objective Caml.  Caml Light is merely a subset of Objective Caml, especially
designed for teaching and learning the art of programming.  In addition to the
Caml Light's core language, Objective Caml features a powerful modules system,
full support to object-oriented paradigm, and an optimizing compiler.

                                        -- <http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/>

	  	 	FORTRAN

Fort mode, for the FORTRAN programming language.

"FORTRAN Example.f"             "Fort Help"

FORTRAN was first developed in the 1950's and still used today.  Its name
comes from "FORmula TRANslation," revealing its early use in processing
mathematics.  Dialects include FORTRAN 77 and FORTRAN 90.  Versions include
FORTRAN II, IV, and V, WATFOR, and WATFIV.

                                                        -- UMLF
	  	 	Fortran90

f90 mode, for the FORTRAN 90 dialect of the FORTAN programming language.

"F90 Example.f90"               "f90 Help"

F90 mode supports the editing of the free-format syntax of Fortran90.


	  	 	Java

Java mode, for the Java programming language.

"Java Example.java"             "Java Help"

Java is a computer language, but very powerful, intended to be machine and
operating-system independent.  Java will enable whatever functions the piece
you call up or download has, including sound, video, etc., on your screen.  It
also is interactive, and can produce dynamic images on your screen, not just
static ones.  It was developed by Sun Micro.  There is a dialect called Hot
Java; on the other hand, JavaScript is a separate language.

                                                        -- UMLF

	  	 	LISP

Lisp mode, for the LISP programming language.

"Lisp Example.el"               "Lisp Help"

LISP is an acronym for LISt Processing.  Its development history has often
been associated with symbolic processing and with both computer and human
languages.  A heterogeneous list data type has always been built into the
language in order to efficiently deal with arbitrary and changing models.
Lisp has evolved into a family of languages.  The two major dialects in use
today are Common Lisp and Scheme.

                                            -- <http://www.lisp.org>

	  	 	makefile

Make mode, for creating/editing/compiling 'makefile' files.

"Makefile Example.m4"            "Make Help"

'Make' is one of the original Unix tools for Software Engineering, by S.I.
Feldman of AT&T Bell Labs circa 1975.  But there are public domain versions
(eg.  GNU) and versions for other systems (eg.  Vax/VMS) as well.  Related
tools are the language compilers (cc, f77, lex, yacc, etc.)  and shell
programming tools (eg.  awk, sed, cp, rm, etc.).  You need to know how to use
these.  Important adjuncts are lint (source code checking for obvious errors)
ctags (locate functions, etc.  in source code) and mkdepend.  These are nice,
and good programmers use them.

                          -- <http://www.hsrl.rutgers.edu/ug/make_help.html>

	  	 	MPW

MPW mode, for Macintosh Programmer's Workshop shell windows.

"MPW Example"                   "Shells"

Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW) is a product designed specifically for
professional Macintosh software developers.  It brings together a
comprehensive collection of development tools designed to support C, C++, and
assembly-language programmers who are writing software for Mac OS 7.x/8.x/9.x.
MPW is an open, configurable, and scriptable development environment which
provides the flexibility to support complex software development projects for

application to be locally installed.  Toolserver shell windows can also be
opened using the "Utils > Toolserver Shell" dynamic menu item, bound to
Control-Command-Y.


	  	 	Objective C

Objc mode, for the Objective C programming language.

"ObjectiveC Example.m"          "Objc Help"

Objective-C is a object oriented superset of C with a Smalltalk style (infix)
message syntax.  It was originally written by Brad Cox and the StepStone
corporation in the early 1980s.  In 1988, it was adopted as the development
language for NeXTstep and was made a part of the GNU gcc compiler in 1992.  It
is currently used as the principle programming language for MacOSX (which is
based on NeXTstep) and as the language for the GNUstep project on Linux and
other platforms.  Objective-C's weak typing and runtime features distinguish
it from C++ and Java.

                                   -- <http://www.dekorte.com/Objective-C/>

	  	 	Pascal

Pasc mode, for the Pascal programming language.

"Pascal Example.p"              "Pasc Help"

The computer language Pascal was developed between 1968 and 1971, from ALGOL.
It was named for the French mathematician Blaise Pascal.  Its
highly-structured nature makes it especially well-suited for developing
algorithms.

	  	 	Perl

Perl mode, which can use Alpha as the front end for MacPerl.

"Perl Example.pl"               "Perl Help"

Perl is an interpreted high-level programming language developed by Larry
Wall.  According to Larry, he included in Perl all the cool features found in
other languages and left out those features that weren't so cool.

Perl has become the premier scripting language of the Web, as most CGI
programs are written in Perl.  However, Perl is widely used as a rapid
prototyping language and a "glue" language that makes it possible for
different systems to work well together.  Perl is popular with system
administrators who use it for an infinite number of automation tasks.

Perl's roots are in UNIX but you will find Perl on a wide range of computing
platforms.  Because Perl is an interpreted language, Perl programs are highly
portable across systems.

	  	 	Python

Pyth mode, for the Python programming language.

"Python Example.py"             "Pyth Help"

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic
data types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power with very clear
syntax.  It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to
various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.  It is also usable as
an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on the Mac, and
on PCs under MS-DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and OS/2.

                                            -- <http://www.python.org>

	  	 	Scheme

Scm mode, for the Scheme programming language.

"Scheme Example.scm"            "Scm Help"

The Scheme dialect of Lisp was created in 1975 by Guy Steele and Gerry Sussman
to explore ideas in programming-language semantics.  They showed that a
powerful language can be made "not by piling feature on top of feature, but by
removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear
necessary".  Scheme pioneered lexical scope in Lisp, first-class
continuations, and tail recursion, and more recently added an advanced macro
system.  It's the best-known Lisp dialect after Common Lisp (which it
influenced).  It is IEEE standardized and widely used in universities and in
electronic CAD systems.

                                            -- <http://www.lisp.org>

	  	 	sh Scripts

sh mode, for unix, linux, or osx shell scripts.  This example is the script
used to generate on-line man reference pages, such as those found at this
site: <http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~christia/man-cgi.html>.

"sh Example.sh"               "sh Help"

The first version of UNIX was created in 1969 by Kenneth Thompson and Dennis
Ritchie, system engineers at AT&T's Bell Labs.  It went through many revisions
and gained in popularity until 1977, when it was first made commercially
available by Interactive Systems Corporation.

At the same time a team from the University of California at Berkeley was
working to improve UNIX. In 1977 it released the first Berkeley Software
Distribution, which became known as BSD. Over time this won favour through
innovations such as the C shell.

Meanwhile the AT&T version was developing in different ways.  The 1978 release
of Version 7 included the Bourne Shell for the first time.  By 1983 commercial
interest was growing and Sun Microsystems produced a UNIX workstation.  System
V appeared, directly descended from the original AT&T UNIX and the prototype
of the more widely used variant today.

                                    -- <http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/>

	  	 	SQL

SQL mode, for Structured Query Language database operations.

"SQL Example.sql"               "SQL Help"

SQL is an open, freely-based computing language that uses certain terminology
to extract information from data sets or to perform operations across a whole
range of data.  The letters stand for Structured Query Language.  Dialects
include Microsoft SQL, ISQL_w, (Native) Dynamic SQL (or NDS), Jet SQL, and
T-SQL (or Transact-SQL); the latter is SQL's server.  Data Definition Language
is a part of SQL.

	  	 	Tcl

Tcl mode, the programming language on which Alpha is based.  Tcl has its own
separate "Tcl 8.4 Commands" and "Tcl-Tk Help" help files.

"Tcl Example.tcl"				"Tcl Help"

Tcl is a string-based command language.  The language has only a few
fundamental constructs and relatively little syntax, which makes it easy to
learn.  The Tcl syntax is meant to be simple (and in this respect differs to
Perl), but this doesn't mean it lacks in power.  Tcl is designed to be a glue
that assembles software building blocks into applications, and is also used as
a scripting language and for building graphical interfaces very quickly (with
the Tk extension).  In addition, Tcl is interpreted when the application runs.
The interpreter makes it easy to build and refine your application in an
interactive manner.  Tcl is also available cross-platform.  Programs written
in Tcl/Tk can run without any changes on Windows, Macintosh (including MacOS
X) and Unix.

Tcl is also used to construct complex applications.  Tcl is used in some
mission-critical satellite control systems; an entire ERP system has been
built in Tcl, and Alphatk is 100% Tcl.

	======================================================================


	  	Science / Stat / Database Modes


Many of Alpha's modes have been written to aid in the editing of source files
used for specific math/statistical/scientific applications.  Many of these
programs are proprietary software, others are freeware.  In some cases, the
mode allows Alpha to serve as the 'front end' for these applications.  While
some of these modes might qualify as a proper computer programming language
mode, they're included here if they primarily support the
creation/manipulation of datasets.


	  	 	CLAN

Clan mode, for "Computerized Language Analysis" files.

"CLAN Example.cha"              "Clan Help"

CLAN is a program that is designed specifically to analyze data transcribed in
the format of the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES).  CLAN was
written by Leonid Spektor at Carnegie Mellon University.  The current version
uses a graphic user interface and runs on both Macintosh and Windows machines.
Earlier versions also ran on DOS and Unix without a graphic user interface.
CLAN allows you to perform a large number of automatic analyses on transcript
data.  The analyses include fre-quency counts, word searches, co-occurrence
analyses, mean length of utterance (MLU) counts, interactional analyses, text
changes, and morphosyntactic analysis.

	  	 	Dot

dot mode, to interact with "graphviz" and edit "dot" files.

"Dot Example.dot"

"graphviz" is open source graph drawing software providing a set of graph
drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows (win32) or MacOSX, including a web
service interface (webdot).  Graph drawing addresses the problem of
visualizing structural information by constructing geometric
representations of abstract graphs and networks.  Automatic generation of
graph drawings has important applications in key technologies such as
database design, software engineering, VLSI and network design and visual
interfaces in other domains.

"dot" is a simple format which describes which nodes should connect to
which other nodes.  Then the sophisticated layout routines quickly render
it into many different output formats.

	  	 	Modula-2

M2 mode, for programming in Modula-2 using the RAMSES or MacMETH shell.

"M2 Example.m2"                 "M2 Help"

Modula-2 was designed by Niklaus Wirth, in 1978.  He had earlier designed
first Pascal, and later the first Modula, both arising out of ALGOL. (All
versions of Modula are included here.)  Modula-2 programs can be divided into
modules (program units capable of hiding some entities comprising them); thus
some modules can make use of low-level computing languages, which may be
necessary for a specific machine, without requiring the entire program to do
so.

                                                        -- UMLF

The RAMSES (Research Aids for Modelling and Simulation of Environmental
Systems) software is a package consisting of a shell, and several so-called
sessions.  Each session serves a particular purpose, modeling, experiment
definition, simulation, and post-simulation analysis and can be run from
within the shell.

Modula-2 for the Macintosh is available as FreeWare, courtesy ETH Zurich as
part of the software packages RAMSES or MacMETH.

	======================================================================



	  	Alpha -- Specific Modes


Some of Alpha's mode are not intended for text editing.  They instead support
different menu items or features.  This section gives examples of how Alpha
might use some of the modes included in the modes pop-up menu (the menu in the
status bar that currently reads 'Text').


	  	 	Browser

Brws mode.  This provides a way to navigate the results of a batch search.
During a batch search, a list of all matching lines are displayed in a Brws
window.  By using the arrow keys and the return key, you can easily jump to
the correct file and line of the match you desire.

"Browser Example"

This example is a hyperlink to the 'Browse Fileset' menu item.


	  	 	Changes

Chng mode, an Alpha Developers tool for editing 'Changes' files.  This link
will open the latest Alpha - Changes file.

"Changes Example"


	  	 	Compare

Diff mode.  This mode allows for powerful side-by-side file comparison and
patching of changes back and forth between two files or directories.

"Compare Example"               "Diff Help"

This link will compare two versions of a Tcl "trains" example file.

An addition "CompareWordByWord Example" link will demonstrate how the content
of two files can be compared when one selects the (dynamic) menu command
"Utils > Compare > Windows Word By Word".


	  	 	Filters

'Fltr' mode is enabled by the package: filtersMenu, which allows for
complicated search and replace functions within Alpha.  For more information,
see the "# Filters " Example below.


	  	 	Install

Inst mode.  This provides support for the Install menu, and is invoked
whenever you open a file containing an installation script, i.e. whenever you
are installing a new package.

"Install Example"               "Extending Alpha"

This link will open such a file, presenting you with installation options.
This script won't actually install anything, and clicking on either 'OK' or
'Cancel' will close the file.  To see the actual Tcl code contained in this
script, hold down any modifier key while you click on the hyperlink.  See the
"Extending Alpha" help file for more installation script information.


	======================================================================


	  	Feature Examples


Many of Alpha's features are best explained with a little tutorial.  This
section contains a small collection of the tutorials currently available.


	  	 	Calculator

This provides a simple calculator for use within Alpha, available from the
"Utils > Calculator" menu item.

"Calculator Example"            "Calculator Help"

This example will return the result of typing  

	1 <cr> 1 + <cr>
	1 <cr> 1 + <cr> 4.2 *

It first calculates 1 + 1, then calculates (1 + 1) * 4.2


	  	 	Dictionary

"Dictionary.Example"            "Dictionaries Help"

The 'Dictionary' package is a small programme running inside Alpha to look up
words in plain-text dictionaries.  Once activated, the Dictionary package
inserts a submenu in the Utils menu.

Preferences: Features

A plain-text dictionary is any text file with one dictionary entry per line,
and sorted alphabetically.  The file may also contain a header with certain
auxiliary Tcl procdures to specify the precise sorting criterium, and how to
format an entry on the screen.  The "Examples/Dictionary-Examples" folder
contains a file 'dictionary-formats' where the header format is explained,
and it also contains four example dictionaries, where you can see what these
headers can look like in practice.  There is also a subfolder with some extra
tools for dictionary management, and instructions for getting dictionaries.


	  	 	Filters

The Filters Menu allows you to do successive Search And Replace operations for
the current window (in any mode).  All the operations are gathered in files
called -- filters -- which you can apply to any text file opened in Alpha.

"Filters Example"               "Filters Help"

This link will open a Filters Tutorial shell window.  The actual files
containing the filter information are opened in 'Fltr' mode, such as the
"Filters Example.flt" file.  These examples will be much more useful if the
Filters package is enable via the "Config > Global Setup > Menus" dialog.

Preferences: Menus


	  	 	Mac Menu

"MacMenu Example"               "Mac Menu Help"

Mac Menu for Alpha allows you to achieve all kinds of files manipulations from
Alpha and to interact with the MacOS file system with maximum flexibility.

You can act upon selections of files taken out of a folder or a hierarchy of
folders and subfolders : the selection is made using a regular expression
(regexp) and setting various additional conditions.  You have thus full and
extended control on which files you want to manipulate.  The "Mac Menu"
package has been designed to activated globally.

Preferences: Menus


	  	 	Macros

"Macros Example"                "Macros Help"

A macro is a sequence of recorded keystrokes that can be played back again.
Unlike other macro packages you might be familiar with in other Mac
applications, keyboard macros in Alpha do not record mouse movement or entries
in system dialogs -- only keystrokes or menu selections are recorded.  Even
with these limitations, you will discover that macros can save you time
through easy automation of repetitive tasks.  The 'Macros' package is a global
feature.

Preferences: Features


	  	 	Mail Menu

This menu allows Alpha serve as a front end to Eudora and other e-mail
software packages for reading and sending e-mail.  You can also read and send
mail using Alpha's internal pop3 and smtp protocols.

"Mail Example"                "Mail Help"

This link will open a mail window and compose a nice note addressed to the
author of this file.  You will need to configure some Mail Menu settings to
send it, though.


	  	 	Manip Cols

"ManipCols Example"             "ManipCols Help"

The 'manipCols' package is a feature which allows one to do various
manipulations with the columns of any tabulated material i.e. a series of
lines in which items are separated by a tabulation or by any other specific
character (like & or a tabulation or a colon, a comma, an endash etc.  or even
the space character).  Once it is installed and activated, it adds a new
submenu named "Text > Columns".  The items of this submenu are explained in
the "ManipCols Help" file.  The 'Manip Cols' package is a global feature.

Preferences: Features


	  	 	Shell Windows

Shel attributes can be attached to other modes to provide an interactive
command-line shell.  For example, use "Utils > Tcl Shell" to access a Tcl
shell. <<tclShell>>

"Shell Example"                 "Shells"

This link will open a Tcl shell and issue the commands 

	cd [file join $HOME]
	cd [file join $HOME "Examples"]
	glob -dir [file join $HOME "Examples"] *
	version
	alertnote "Hello World."

Some of these commands are Tcl commands, others are specific to AlphaTcl. 

Individual shell commands can also be executed using the status bar window by
first pressing Escape-X. Try typing

	alertnote "This is a test"

and then pressing return for an example.  This is a very handy tool for
AlphaTcl developers to debug routines without having to first open a
<<tclShell>> window.

Several packages in AlphaTcl also create shell windows to environments other
than the internal Tcl shell, such as the package: macMenu (see "# Mac Menu"
above).  Also see the "# MPW" information above.

	  	Technical Notes


Any file with 'Example' in the filename will automatically be installed in the
Examples folder.  All of the hyperlinks in this help document (as well as
others) use the proc: help::openExample.  Any Help file can take advantage of
this procedure to include hyperlinks to any example file included in the
'Examples' folder.

Important: 'Example' filenames must be '<something>-Example.sfx', where
<something> is an alpha-numeric string and .sfx is recognized by Alpha in the
"Config > Global Setup > Suffix Mappings" preference.

The dash in the filename is important and cannot be omitted !!

See the help file "Help Files Help" for more information about creating
auto-hyperizing help files, and the syntax for automatic hyperlinks.
