<HR><P><H2><A NAME="M1"></A>Introduction</H2><P>Mac Menu for Alpha allows you to achieve all kinds of  files  manipulations
from Alpha and  to  interact  with  the  MacOS  file  system  with  maximum
flexibility.<P>You can act upon selections of files taken out of a folder or  a  hierarchy
of folders  and  subfolders:  the  selection  is  made  using  a  regular
expression (regexp) and setting various  additional  conditions.  You  have
thus full and extended control on which files you want to manipulate.<P>Actions executed on the selected files are:  copying,  moving,  renaming,
duplicating, trashing/untrashing, locking  or  unlocking,  making  aliases,
selecting or unselecting, listing, changing creator type.<P>You can also get complete system information about all  kinds  of  elements
such as files, folders, disks,  processes  etc.  and  set  new  values  for
certain properties (change a type, a creator, a modification date,  sharing
status etc.). Commands  are  also  provided  for  basic  Finder's  tasks:
emptying the trash, restarting the computer etc.<P>All the commands are available from a menu called Mac Menu but the  package
also implements a 'shell' to execute all these  functions  from  a  command
line. For instance, just type 'empty' at the prompt of Mac Shell  to  empty
the trash. A very simple syntax  is  provided  to  write  commands  and  to
navigate in the MacOS files system.<P>All these actions are executed  without  leaving  the  Alpha  editor.  The
package is almost exclusively based on Apple Events sent to the system.<P>See the tutorial file and  read  more  information  below  for  a  complete
description of all the items available in Mac Menu.<P>Starting from version 2.3, Mac Menu runs only with AlphaX on OSX. To run it
under OS8 or OS9 you must get an older version of the package.<P><H2><A NAME="M2"></A>Installation</H2>
<A NAME="M35"></A>
<H3><A NAME="M3"></A>Automatic installation</H3><P>If you received Mac Menu with a regular distribution of Alpha, there's
nothing particular to do: it is already installed and you just have to turn
it on (see <I>After installing</I> below). Otherwise, the simplest way of
installing the package is to use the automatic installation facility. Just
double-click on the <I>OPEN TO INSTALL</I> file. Opening this file tells Alpha
that a new package has to be installed: the procedure is automatic. Alpha
knows where to store the different elements of your 'Mac Menu' package.<P><H3><A NAME="M4"></A>Manual installation</H3><P>If you prefer a manual installation, take the following steps:
<OL>
	<LI> put the <I>macMenu</I> folder in the <I>Menus</I> subfolder of the
<I>Tcl</I> folder which is located at the same level as your Alpha
application<P>	<LI> put the <I>Mac Menu Help</I> files in the <I>Help</I> folder located at the same
level as your Alpha application. Next time you launch Alpha, you will see a
<I>Mac Menu Help</I> item in the Help menu.<P>	<LI> put the <I>MacMenu-Example</I> and <I>MacMenu-Example.tcl</I> files in thefolder
called <I>Mode  Examples</I>  and  located  at  the  same  level  as  the  Alpha
application.<P>	<LI> launch Alpha. You have to  rebuild  the  package  indices  and  the  Tcl
indices. <I>Rebuild Package Indices</I> is in  the  Config / Packages  menu,  and
<I>Rebuild Tcl Indices</I> is in the Tcl menu.<P>	<LI> quit Alpha and relaunch it: that's all there is to it.
</OL><P><H3><A NAME="M5"></A>After installing</H3><P>Have a look at the Mac Menu preferences in the <I>Packages</I>  submenu  of  the
<I>Config</I> menu. You can set various flags there. More explanations below.<P><P><IMG SRC="../Images/macmenu.gif" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><H2><A NAME="M6"></A>Quick start</H2><P>Suppose you have a folder containing all the pages of a Web  site  and  you
want a list of the image files having extension gif or jpeg. 
In the <I>List Files</I> dialog window, specify the folder and click on the
<I>Extensions</I> button. In the new window check gif and jpeg and press OK.
This brings back to the previous window in which the Files Filter is now
set like this:
<PRE>
    .*\.(jpeg|gif)
</PRE>
Click OK and you get the list you wanted. You could have specified 
<I>In all Subfolders</I> in the <I>Process</I> popup menu to get a list including
files in the nested subfolders.<P>Suppose now you want to send to another folder a copy of  the  files  taken
out of this structure whose names meet the following requirements:
<UL>
	<LI> first letter is A or P
	<LI> the extension is htm or html
	<LI> the name contains a suffix _XY
	<LI> the files were modified after Dec 25, 2000
	<LI> their size is less than 128k (to exclude big images for instance)
</UL>
You have to  build  a  regular  expression  representing  the  first  three
conditions. In the <I>Copy Files</I> dialog window, the Files Filter should be:
<PRE>
    [AP].*_XY\.html?
</PRE>
Then click on the <I>Add conditions</I> button and in the new  window,  set  the
last two contitions like so:
<PRE>
    Modification date after 2000-12-25
    Size greater than 128k
</PRE>
leaving the other fields blank.
Clicking on <I>Apply</I> brings back to the previous dialog in which you set the
paths of the source and the target folders. In the  <I>Process</I>  popup  menu,
choose <I>in all Subfolders</I>. Now click on <I>Copy</I> and there you go. The  copy
sent to the target folder will reproduce  exactly  the  same  hierarchy  of
folders and subfolders but will contain only the files corresponding to the
required scheme.<P>Now suppose you want to rename the selected files. You want the new name to
be like this:
<UL>
	<LI> first letter Q instead of A or P
	<LI> following letters unchanged
	<LI> no _XY suffix
	<LI> extension <I>old</I>
	<LI> all file names in uppercase letters
</UL>
Unless you cancelled in the <I>Copy Files</I> dialog window, all  your  settings
will have been preserved when you open the <I>Rename Files</I> window. You  have
just one modification to do in the Files Filter regular expression: add  a
pair of parentheses to capture the .* part which will be refered to  as  \1
in the substitution expression:
<PRE>
    [AP](.*)_XY\.html?
</PRE>
The replacement string will then be:
<PRE>
    Q\1\.old
</PRE>
To have uppercase letters, click on the <I>Add options</I> button.  In  the  new
window, click on the <I>Casing</I> checkbox and choose UPPERCASE  in  the  popup
menu. Click <I>Apply</I> then click <I>Rename</I>. That's all there is to it.<P><H2><A NAME="M7"></A>Dialogs description</H2>
<A NAME="M36"></A>
Almost all the  dialog  windows  in  which  you  specify  the  options  and
conditions related to some kind of file manipulation share common elements.<P><H3><A NAME="M8"></A>Main selection dialogs</H3>
<A NAME="M37"></A>
The top part of the dialog is an edit field in which you  write  a  regular
expression describing the naming scheme of the files you want to act  upon.
It is very important to note that it obeys the regular  expressions  syntax
and not the so-called 'globbing syntax' used in some Tcl commands. For more
info about the regular expressions, read the <I>Regular Expressions</I> file  in
the Help Menu. Regular expressions are a very powerful syntax  designed  to
describe abstractly almost any kind of strings.<P>The top part of the dialog windows also contains  two  check  boxes  called
<I>case sensitive</I> and <I>negate filter</I>: check or uncheck them as  you  want.
If the <I>negate filter</I> checkbox is checked, Mac Menu will search for  files
which do NOT correspond to the files  filter  regular  expression.  If  the
<I>case sensitive</I> checkbox is unchecked, Mac Menu will not take casing  into
account: uppercase and lowercase letters will be considered equivalent.
The <I>Add Conditions</I> button calls a new dialog  window  in  which  you  can
specify additional options concerning the MacOS  type  or  creator  of  the
files, the date of creation or modification and the size (in kbytes). Dates
are indicated in the ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd).<P>NB: the <I>negate  filter</I>  flag,  if  set,  negates  the  filtering  regular
expression but NOT the additional conditions. They are... additional.<P>A pop-up menu lets you specifiy whether an action should be  taken  on  all
the files corresponding to the filter in the current directory,  or  should
be extended to the subfolders down to a specified level as well or even  to
all subfolders, subsubfolders etc.<P>Almost all the dialog windows contain an edit field to specify  the  source
folder: the folder in which to look for files or the folder at the top  of
the hierarchy if subfolders are concerned too. You can write  the  complete
path of the source folder in the edit field or  use  the  <I>Set</I>  button  to
browse through the file system with a standard dialog.<P>When relevant (to copy or move files), an additional edit  field  lets  you
choose a target folder.  If  files  are  taken  out  of  a  hierarchy,  the
hierarchy will be transported to  the  target  folder:  if  corresponding
subfolders do not  exist  in  the  target  folder,  they  will  be  created
automatically. If the target folder itself does not exist,  it  is  created
too so you can specify the name of a non existing folder in the edit field.
Use the <I>Set</I> button to choose an existing folder.<P>All the dialog windows have at least two buttons  at  the  bottom:  one  to
execute the desired action, one to cancel.<P><H3><A NAME="M9"></A>Renaming dialog</H3>
<A NAME="M38"></A>
The <I>Rename Files</I> dialog window contains  a  specific  field  to  set  the
renaming scheme: it uses the substitution syntax of  regular  expressions.
So you can use the special substitution symbols: & to designate the entire
match, \1, \2 etc. to designate sub-expressions corresponding to  pairs  of
parentheses in the files filtering regular expression.
A button called <I>Add Options</I> brings up a new dialog window  in  which  you
can choose more options. They concern  casing,  incremental  numbering  and
truncating. Tey have the following meaning:
<UL>
	<LI> the casing option is  self  explanatory:  change  to  <I>UPPERCASE</I>  or
<I>lowercase</I>, <I>Capitalize Words</I> or <I>Capitalize first</I> letter only.<P>	<LI> the numbering facility has various settings: numbering  from  zero  or
from one, appending the number at the beginning or at the  end  of  the  new
file name, number in increasing or decreasing order. The <I>padd  with  zeros</I>
option corresponds to the insertion of zeros at the left of the number  when
necessary: such as in 01, 02 etc. or 001, 002 etc.<P>	<LI> the truncating facility lets you specify a format for the new file 
names.
The default value  is  8.3  which  corresponds  to  the  MS-DOS  limitation
concerning file names: eight letters at most, a dot, three letters at  most
after the dot. The general syntax is m[.n] which means a single integer  or
two integers separated by a dot as in the 8.3 example. In  the  first  case
all file names will be truncated to a maximum of m  characters  whereas  in
the second case, if a file name has an extension, the part before  the  dot
will be truncated to a maximum of m characters and the part after  the  dot
to a maximum of n characters.
</UL><P><H3><A NAME="M10"></A>Particular dialogs</H3>
<A NAME="M39"></A>
The <I>Trash Files</I> dialog has no target folder field:  the  target  is  the
trash. The <I>Untrash Files</I> dialog is different from the others and proposes
two options: <I>last trashed</I> or <I>all</I>. In the first case, will be untrashed
(i-e sent back to their original position in the  files  system)  only  the
files most recently trashed from the <I>Trash Files</I> item in  the  Mac  Menu.
This is a sort of 'undo' facility if you have accidentally trashed files or
have a remorse. With the <I>all</I> option, all the files currently in the trash
will be untrashed.<P><A NAME="M40"></A>
The <I>Change Creator</I> dialog has an additional button called <I>Other</I>: if  a
creator type is not in the popup menu, you can specify  another  one.  This
button brings up a new dialog with an edit field to enter the  new  creator
type (four chars maximum). If you do  not    know    the    creator    type
corresponding to an application, use the <I>Same as</I> button and indicate  the
application or any document created  with  this  application.  The  <I>Apply</I>
button selects the new type and brings back the <I>Change Creator</I>  dialog  ;
the <I>Add&Apply</I> button has the same effect but additionally records the new
type in the popup menu to make it available for future  use  (the  list  is
reset though each time Alpha is relaunched: to make an addition  permanent
use the Mac Menu Preferences. See section below about preferences).<P><A NAME="M41"></A>
The <I>Extensions</I> button is a facility  to  specify  files  with  particular
extensions. It brings up a new dialog with several checkboxes:  select  the
extensions you're interested in by checking the corresponding checkbox. The
corresponding files filter regular expression will be  built  automatically
in the main dialog  window.  If  an  extension  is  not  mentioned  in  the
<I>Predefined Extensions</I> dialog window, you have two possibilities:
<UL>
	<LI> for a temporary usage, enter it in the <I>Other extensions</I> edit  field.
A list of space-separated extensions can be entered there.  You  can  enter
the extensions with or without the dot, this makes no difference.<P>	<LI> for a permanent usage, you  might  want  to  add  your  favorite  file
extensions to the Mac Menu Preferences (see the section  about  preferences
below). In this case, the new extensions will have a checkbox of their own.
 
</UL><P><H3><A NAME="M11"></A>Information dialog windows</H3><P><A NAME="M42"></A>
The information windows display information about  all  kinds  of  items:
files, folders, volumes, applications, processes or  basic  hardware.  They
almost all have a <I>Dismiss</I>, a <I>Get Text</I>. The File Infos dialog also has a
<I>Set</I> button. With the <I>Dismiss</I> button, you simply quit  the  dialog.  The
<I>Get Text</I> button sends  the  collected  information  to  a  separate  text
window.
The <I>Set</I> button allows you to set  some  properties:  the  corresponding
fields are editable (an edit field for a  variable  or  a  checkbox  for  a
flag). You validate your modifications with the <I>Set</I> button. Note that  if
your file is locked the modifications are not appliable:  you  must  first
unlock it. Be aware of what you are doing: changing low  level  properties
is potentially dangerous. Don't play with the system files.
In the case of a shared volume or folder, and if file sharing is on on  the
system, there is an additional <I>Sharing</I> button which gets and displays the
complete sharing information about the item.<P><H2><A NAME="M12"></A>Menu Items Description</H2><P>Here is the list of all the menu items of the Mac Menu  with  explanations.

<A NAME="M70"></A>
The Mac shell provides a command line facility analogous to the  Tcl  shell
('cmd-y') or the now obsolete Toolsever shell already available in Alpha.
You can open it with the <I>Mac Shell</I> menu item or with the 'ctrl-cmd-y'  key
combination. This section lists all  the  commands  available  in  the  Mac
Shell.
<P> The main commands are 'help',  'files'  and  'infos'.  There  are  also
commands which allow you to navigate in the MacOS  files  system:  'pwd',
'cd', 'ls', 'ld'. Additionally you have a few utility commands:  'empty',
'eject', 'restart', 'shutdown' which behave  like  the  corresponding  menu
items. 
Please see the tutorial (choose <I>Mac  Menu  Tutorial</I>  in  the  <I>Get  Info</I>
submenu) for real life examples.
<P> Certain options are not handled from the command line though:  if  you
want to specify additional  conditions  (as  explained  above)  you  should
rather use the dialog windows.
<P> If a command is not a specific Mac Shell command, MacMenu  will  try  to
evaluate it as a Tcl instruction. If no Tcl command is found, then  it  will
try to execute it as a Unix command (only on OSX). This means that  you  can
use Mac Shell as a Tcl shell and that you can execute Unix command  directly
from Alpha (see more precisions in the <I>Unix commands</I> section below).<P><H3><A NAME="M16"></A>Shell prompt</H3>
The shell prompt always indicates the  name  of  the  current  folder.  When
opening the shell, its value defaults to the Alpha application's main folder

preference). <P><H3><A NAME="M17"></A>'help' command</H3>

</UL><P><P> The -b flag (b stands for 'by') is used only by <I>files list</I> and
allows you to specifiy a sorting option. The option is specified by one of

<I>Labels</I>.<P>It is essential that  the  filtering  regular  expression  be  enclosed  in
brackets if some characters are escaped. The brackets protect  the  escaped
characters from being iterpreted by the Tcl interpreter before the  regular
expressions interpreter. For instance, to designate all files ending with a
dot followed by one single number you want to use the following expression:
<PRE>
     .*\.\d
</PRE>
so you should write on the command line 
<PRE>
    -f {.*\.\d}
</PRE>
If you do not enclose the regular expression in brackets, you  must  escape
the characters twice i-e with a double backslash like this:
<PRE>
    -f .*\\.\\d
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
    -f ".*\\.\\d"
</PRE>
This remark concerns  exclusively  the  regular  expressions  used  on  the
command line: there is no need of brackets when you use the menu items and
dialog windows.<P>If the -d flag is on (-d 1) the numbering will be done. There is no way  to
set the numbering options from the command line.  The  last  used  settings
will be applied.<P><H4><A NAME="M20"></A>Subcommands of the 'files' command</H4><P>Here is the list of the various subcommands you can append to  the  'files'

respectively like in any Unix shell). In can be used in different manners:
lt)) 
<DL><P><DT><B>cd</B><DL><DT>

change to directory of second to frontmost window (ie the window which is

To go several levels up, type .. followed by several separators (thus, .. is 
equivalent to ../). E-g:

</TABLE></P><P><H3><A NAME="M24"></A>Unix commands</H3>
<A NAME="M84"></A>
On OSX, if a command hasn't been defined as a specific MacShell command  and
fails to be executed as a Tcl command, then MacShell attempts to  invoke  it
as a Unix command. It does this using the <B>exec</B>  Tcl  command:  this  means
that it will work only if it is a non interactive Unix command, i-e if it is
a command which returns its result immediately  without  waiting  for  input
from the user and which does not  have  to  be  terminated  (by  ctrl-D  for
instance). Otherwise Alpha will enter in an infinite loop.
<P> Typical examples of commands which can be  executed  from  MacShell  are
<B>cal</B>, <B>date</B>, <B>df</B>, <B>ls</B>,  <B>who</B>,  <B>ps</B>  etc.  
But  don't  try  to  execute
commands such as <I>top</I>, <I>stats</I> etc.<P><H3><A NAME="M25"></A>Commands history</H3>
<A NAME="M85"></A>
As with any Alpha shell, you can move through  commands  history  with  the
'up' and 'down' arrow keys while holding the 'control key' down.
If you option-click in the title bar of the Mac shell, you also have a list
of the last twenty command lines and you can select any of them which  will
be inserted in the shell.<P><H3><A NAME="M26"></A>Extending Mac Shell</H3>
<A NAME="M86"></A>
You can create your own commands to use in  Mac  Shell.  To  create  a  new
command called <I>mycmd</I>, you must define a proc named macsh::mycmd  and  the
value returned by this proc should be the text you want to be  inserted  in
Mac Shell as a reply when the command is executed. If you  want  no  reply,
just return the empty string "". For instance:
<PRE>
    proc macsh::mycmd {} {
        return "myvalue"
    }
</PRE><P>The proc macsh::mycmd can take parameters and arguments depending  on  what
syntax you  want  for  your  command  (subcommands,  additional  arguments,
options etc.). Please see various examples in the files macMenuShell.tcl 
and macMenuInterface.tcl.<P>You can create as many new commands as  you  wish.  These  commands  can  be
stored in a file like this one. The easiest solution is to locate this  file
in the MacMenu folder and to rebuild the Tcl indices to register your  procs
in Alpha. You must put the following instruction at  the  beginning  of  the
file: 
<PRE>
    namespace eval macsh {}
</PRE><P>You can also provide help info about a command by defining an entry in the 
macsh_help() array. Its value must be a list of items corresponding to all 
the subcommands of mycmd.
For instance, if you define
<PRE>
    set macsh_help(mycmd) [list "open [myoptions] [myarguments]" "close"]
</PRE>
the following line will be printed in MacShell when typing <I>help mycmd</I>
<PRE>
    mycmd open [myoptions] [myarguments]
    mycmd close
</PRE>
    
See more examples in the file <I>macMenuShellMore.tcl</I>.<P><H2><A NAME="M27"></A>MacMenu programming interface</H2>
MacMenu provides procedures which can be used in Tcl  scripts  directly  and
make all the MacMenu capacities available programmatically (instead  of  via
the dialogs interface). These procedures have exactly the same syntax as the
commands described in the <I>Mac Shell</I> section: the only difference  is  that
they must be executed in  the  macsh::  namespace.  For  instance,  you  can
invoke, in a Tcl script, the command macsh::files like this:
<PRE>
	macsh::files copy -f {.*\.tex} -t "/Users/bernardo/thesis"
</PRE><P>The macsh::files and macsh::infos procs in particular  provide  exactly  the
same functionalities as  the  dialogs  corresponding  to  the  MacMenu  menu
commands. <P><H2><A NAME="M28"></A>Completion mechanism</H2>
<A NAME="M87"></A>
There is a  pathname  completion  mechanism  bound  to  the  tabulation  key
(exactly like in most Unix shells).<P>Type the first letters of a file's or folder's name and hit the TAB key: the
procedure will try to complete, looking either for the relative or  absolute
path of a file or folder included in the current folder. A complete path  is
supposed to start with a double quote in order to handle spaces in the path.
These double quotes will be added automatically when necessary. If there are
several possible choices, a pick list is displayed.<P>Note that you can use the symbols tilde and dot at the beginning of  a  path
to designate the user's home directory or the  current  folder  respectively
like in any Unix shell. Mac Shell will do the substitution automatically.<P><H2><A NAME="M29"></A>Getting info</H2><P>The <I>Get Info</I> submenu allows  you  to  get  (and  set)  information  about
various kinds of elements:  file,  folder,  volume,  application,  running
process and the computer itself. The results  are  displayed  in  a  dialog
window. <P>All these information windows have a button called <I>Get Text</I> to  edit  the
results in a separate text window.<P>When appropriate, if a specific piece of information has a value which  can
be set or modified, it is edited in an editable field or with a checkbox so
that you can change its value. Use the <I>Set</I> button to validate changes.<P>The search of information can be slow on... slow machines.  Note  that  the
information about hardware will be sought by the  package  only  the  first

<A NAME="M89"></A>
The <I>Mac Menu Prefs...</I> item in the <I>Packages</I> submenu of the <I>Config</I>
menu allows you to set a few general options:
<UL> 
	<LI> the <I>Overwrite If Exists</I> flag concerns already existing files in
the target folder during a move or a copy action. If this flag is set,
you will not be warned about it.  If  not,  you  will  have  an  error
message indicating the name of the already existing file and the  copy
or move will attempt to proceed on the next subfolder: in  this  case
no file will be overwritten. It is safer not to set this flag:  there
is a <I>force overwrite</I> checkbox  in  the  copy  and  move  dialogs  to
temporarily modify this behaviour when necessary.
	<LI> the <I>Chunks Size</I> variable is a number:  it  is  the  number  of
files which will be processed simultaneously during a copy or  a  move
action. Due to Apple Events  memory  limitations,  files  have  to  be
processed by chunks. I'm not sure what the optimal value should be.  A
default of 200 has proven absolutely safe with very long access  paths
: with shorter pathnames, it can be increased upto 300 and maybe more.
	<LI> the <I>Additional  Types</I>  variable  lets  you  specify  additional
application signatures for the <I>Creator</I> popup in the <I>Change Creator</I>
dialog window.
	<LI> the <I>Predef Extensions</I> variable lets you specify the  extensions
which will have a check box of their own in  the  Predef  Exts  dialog
window. 
	<LI> the <I>Default Home</I> preference specifies, in Mac Shell, where 
[pwd] should start from and where [cd] without argument should lead to. 
The possible choices are <I>Alpha's folder</I> or <I>User's Home</I>.

Added item to delete the resource fork of selected files.

	<LI> 2.2 - 03/11/18 - Eliminated unneeded -r flags in tclAE::send which 
slowed down some commands. Better error checking. Modified the syntax for 
the cd command in MacShell: it is simpler and more robust, it resolves 
tilde paths. New "Default Home" pref on OSX. Correctly 
quotes extensions in filter when they contain metachars. Fixed popup width 
problem introduced by OS Panther. Support for non-interactive Unix 
commands. New MacShell commands.

</UL><P><H2><A NAME="M33"></A>Known problems</H2>
<UL>
	<LI> I decided not to implement any erase command because it is potentially
too dangerous: if you want to erase your disks, choose another tool ;-)
	<LI> It may happen that, though an action has been performed  
succesfully, its
effect is not displayed immediately by the Finder.
	<LI> After long and intensive use, it happens that Alpha seems not to  
execute the Apple Events any more: it is a problem of memory management in 
old versions of Alpha.
Just quit and relaunch the application to refresh it.
