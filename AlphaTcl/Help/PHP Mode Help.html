<H2><A NAME="anchor1"></A>Introduction</H2>

<P>This mode implements very basic mode-specific settings to write
and edit PHP files in Alpha. It currently provides the following
features:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>syntax coloring
   
   <LI>comments handling
   
   <LI>function definitions marking
   
   <LI>basic completion namely : keywords completion and electrics
   for conditional structures
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>PHP mode will be developed further in the future when AlphaX (a
carbonized version of Alpha running on OSX) is available. Any
contributions are welcome.</P>

<H2><A NAME="anchor2"></A>Installation</H2>

<H3><A NAME="anchor3"></A>Automatic installation</H3>

<P>Open the "OPEN TO INSTALL" file. Opening this file tells Alpha
that a new package has to be installed : the procedure is automatic.
Alpha knows where to store the different elements of your PHP Mode
package.</P>

<H3><A NAME="anchor4"></A>Manual installation</H3>

<UL>
   <LI>put the "PHPMode.tcl" file in the "Modes" subfolder of the
   "Tcl" folder which is located at the same level as your Alpha
   application
   
   <LI>put the "PHP Mode Help" file in the "Help" folder located at
   the same level as your Alpha application. Next time you launch
   Alpha, you will have a "PHP Mode Help" item in the Help menu to
   edit this file.
   
   <LI>launch Alpha. You have to rebuild the package indices and the
   Tcl ones. "Rebuild Package Indices" is in the "Config--Packages"
   menu, and "Rebuild Tcl Indices" is in the Tcl menu.
   
   <LI>quit Alpha and relaunch it : that's all there is to it.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="anchor5"></A>Electrics</H2>

<P>PHP mode defines electric expansions for the following keywords :
</P>

<PRE> if, ifelse, ifelseif, elseif, while, do, for,
 foreach, foreachkey, switch, php
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>This means that you just have to type one of them and then hit the
completion key (the Electric Completions package must be active) and
they will expand to a complete structure which you can fill very
easily : it contains electric tabs, ie bullet symbols, and you can
jump from one to the following using the Tab key. For instance,
typing 'do' (without the quotes) and completing yields :</P>

<PRE> do {
     
     } while ( );
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>Typing 'for' (without the quotes) and completing yields :</P>

<PRE> for ( ;  ;  ) {
      
     }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>Typing 'for' (without the quotes) and completing yields :</P>

<PRE> switch () {
       case  :
          
       default:
          
     }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="anchor6"></A>Words completion</H2>

<P>PHP mode also have a system of language keywords completion. Type
the first letters of a keyword and Alpha will complete. If there are
several choices, you'll be prompted to choose one of them. For
instance, type 'sh' (without the quotes) and hit the completion key
to get 'shuffle'.</P>

<P>It you type imaget and hit the completion key, a list will be
displayed with the possible choices which are in this case :
imagettfbbox, imagettftext, imagetypes.</P>

<H2><A NAME="anchor7"></A>File marking</H2>

<P>All the functions defined in the document with the following
scheme</P>

<PRE>  function foo ($arg_1, $arg_2, ..., $arg_n) {
      Instructions here...
  }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>can be marked and made accessible via the "M" popup menu in the
top-right corner of the document's window.</P>

<H2><A NAME="anchor8"></A>Preferences</H2>

<P>A few preferences can be set in the PHP Mode Preferences which you
access from the "Config -- Mode Prefs -- Preferences..." menu item.
Among other choices you can set :</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the prefix string (Default is // )
   
   <LI>the syntax coloring
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Color for comments (Default is red)
      
      <LI>Color for keywords (Default is blue)
      
      <LI>Color for strings (Default is green)
      
      <LI>Color for delimiters (Default is magenta)
   </UL>
