<HR><P><H2><A NAME="anchor1"></A> Introduction</H2><P>The  Filters  Menu  allows  you  to  do  successive  "Search  And  Replace"
operations. All the operations are gathered in files called "filters"
which you can apply to any text file opened in Alpha.
<UL>
	<LI> You can mix various kinds of "Search And Replace" in the same  filter:
textual or regular  (i-e  with  grep  patterns),  case  sensitive  or  not,
matching exact words or not.<P>	<LI> You can write your own filters  and  collect  them  in  the  "Filters"
folder. They are immediatly available. The syntax of the  filters  is  very
simple (see below).<P>	<LI> You can also combine filters and  build  a  Multi  Filter  :  all  the
filters in the Multi Filter will be applied sequentially  to  your  current
window. <P>	<LI> For temporary operations which you do not want to store in  a  filter,
you can use the Temporary Filter.<P>	<LI> All the "Search And Replace" operations can be applied to a whole file
or to a selected region only.<P>	<LI> Filters and Multi Filters can be applied to all the text  files  in  a
same folder.<P></UL>
This is a find-and-replace gizmo that works on  its  own,  using  just  the
items in the Filters menu. One doesn't have  to  use  the  Find  window  or
command line but uses filters instead.<P><H2><A NAME="anchor2"></A> Installation</H2><P><H3><A NAME="anchor3"></A> Automatic installation</H3><P>Open the "OPEN TO INSTALL" file. Opening this file indicates to Alpha  that
a new package has to be installed : the procedure is automatic. Alpha knows
where to store the different elements of your Filters Menu package.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor4"></A> Manual installation</H3>
<OL>
	<LI> put the "Filters Menu" folder in the "Menus" subfolder  of  the  "Tcl"
folder which is located at the same level as your Alpha application :  this
folder contains the file "filterMenu.tcl" and  a  folder  called  "Filters"
where all the filters are stored. If there is no "Filters" folder there, it
will be created automatically by the Filters Menu. <P>In versions of Filters Menu prior to 1.5, the Filters folder was located in
the UserModifications folder : if you have personal filters stored there 
you will have to move them to the new location.<P>	<LI> put the "Filters Help" file in the "Help" folder located at  the  same
level as your Alpha application. Next time you launch Alpha, you will  have
a "Filters Help" item in the Help menu.<P>	<LI> launch Alpha. You have to rebuild the  package  indices  and  the  Tcl
indices. "Rebuild Package Indices" is  in  the  Config/Packages  menu,  and
"Rebuild Tcl Indices" is in the Tcl menu (press cmd-Y to open a tcl shell).
 
	<LI> quit Alpha and relaunch it : that's all there is to it. <P></OL><P><H3><A NAME="anchor5"></A> After installing</H3>
Have a look at the Filters Menu preferences in the  "Packages"  submenu  of
the "Config" menu. You can set various flags. More explanations below.<P><P><IMG SRC="../Images/filtersmenu.gif" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><H2><A NAME="anchor6"></A> Tutorial</H2><P>For any conversion you want to do, you have to select an appropriate filter
with the "Pick a filter" menu item. This  filter  contains  the  conversion
instructions : it is a simple list of strings to find and  of  replacements
for these strings. Then if you want to convert an entire  file,  this  file
must be open in the current window : just select the "Apply to  file"  menu
item and the conversion will be accomplished. If you want to convert only a
part of your current file, hilite the corresponding region and  choose  the
"Apply to selection" menu item.<P>Note that the selected filter which you apply to your file or to  a  region
does not have to be open. Once you picked it, it is the active filter.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor7"></A> First example</H3>
Suppose your file is full of accented letters and you want to strip all the
accents (to send an e-mail for instance). You can select the filter  called
"Strip The Accents". Once it is selected, you will  see  its  name  at  the
bottom of the Filters menu. Bring your current file's window to  the  front
and choose the "Apply to file" menu item.
Alternatively you can use the following  key  binding  :  hit  'control-f',
release, then hit the 'f' key. If you convert only a selected  region,  hit
'control-f', release, then hit the 's' key. To pick a filter you  can  also
use 'control-f p'.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor8"></A> Second example</H3>
Suppose no filter suits your needs. You'll have to write your own. This  is
very easy. Choose the "New Filter" menu item  in  the  "Filters  Utilities"
submenu. You'll be prompted for a name to give to  the  new  filter.  Let's
call it "MyNewFilter" : this new filter is now the active  filter.  Suppose
you want to change in a text all the occurences of  J.S.  Bach  in  L.  van
Beethoven, then to delete all the occurences of the ¤ character and finally
to replace multiple tabulations by a single one. You have to type the three
following lines (more about the filters syntax later) where  the  arguments
are tab-separated :
<PRE>
 J.S. Bach	L. van Beethoven
 ¤
 \t+	\t	1
</PRE>
Save your filter and apply it as in the preceding example.  You  can  check
the syntax of your new filter thanks to the "Check Syntax" menu item in the
Filters Utilities submenu (or hit control-f c).<P><H3><A NAME="anchor9"></A> Third example: multi filters</H3>
Suppose you want to apply several filters successively : for instance "Html
To Accents" then "Accents To Rtf". This can be done in one run thanks to 
the
MultiFilter. The MultiFilter will be the list of filters you want to  apply
(in the order you want them to be applied). To build such a list, hold  the
option key down then open the Filters menu : instead of "Pick a filter" its
first item will now be "Build a multifilter" which brings a list of all the
filters available. This list will be brought to you  repeatedly  until  you
have chosen all the filters you want and have finished  with  the  "cancel"
button. To apply the Multifilter to a selection, a file or a  folder,  hold
down the option key and select the corresponding item in the Filters menu.
 
<H3><A NAME="anchor10"></A> Fourth example: temporary filter</H3>
If you want to do temporary conversions on the fly and do not want to  keep
them in a filter, you have the Temporary Filter. You use  it  exactly  like
any other filter. The only difference is that the instructions you write in
it will not be saved. They will remain only as long  as  you  do  not  quit
Alpha and do not close it.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor11"></A> More examples</H3>
See the filter called Example  (file  example.flt).  Most  of  the  filters
provided with the Filters Menu deal with accents conversions  but  you  can
imagine many kinds of conversions. A more advanced example is given in  the
"Convert Html To Latex" filter which converts an Html document to  a  latex
source file ready to process with LaTeX.<P><H2><A NAME="anchor12"></A> Filters syntax</H2><P>Every "Search And Replace" operation is described by a line whose syntax is
as follows :<P><PRE>
 searchString    replacementString    [option]
</PRE><P>   where the three arguments are separated by one or more tabulations.
The option is a (possibly empty) string containing 0 or 1 and/or one of the
letters i and m with the following signification :
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>0</TD><TD>(or nothing) for an ordinary textual search (this is the default)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>for a search with regular expressions. In this case "searchString" </TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>and "replacementString" can be any regular expression.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>i</TD><TD>for a case insensitive search. If there is no i, the search will </TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>be case sensitive.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>m</TD><TD>to match words exactly (not only a substring of a word). </TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>If there is no m, the search will match any substring.</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P><P>The options can be combined (in any order) : 
    0m, im1, i, 0m etc. (01 means 1).<P>A line starting with two exclamation signs (!!) is considered a comment and
not a filter instruction.<P>All the filters are located in the Filters subfolder of the "Filters  Menu"
folder included in the "Tcl:Menus" folder  of  Alpha's  distribution.  They
have an extension ".flt" to identify them.<P><H3><A NAME="anchor13"></A> Included filters</H3>
There is the possibility (since version 1.6 of Filters Menu) of  calling  a
filter from within a filter. The syntax for this is :
<PRE>
 !!includefilter  "name-of-filter"
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
 !!inputfilter  "name-of-filter"
</PRE>
The keywords 'includefilter' and 'inputfilter' are synonymous.  The  double
exclamation point must be at the beginning of a line and no  space  follows
it. The includefilter  command  is  followed  by  one  or  several  spacing
characters (spaces or tabulations) and the name  of  the  filter  (with  or
without the ".flt" extension). The double quotes are optional:  use  should
use them if the name  of  the  filter  contains  spaces  for  the  sake  of
legibility (but even in that case, they are not required).<P>When an includefilter or inputfilter statement is encountered,  the  entire
included filter is executed  before  continuing  with  the  next  line.  An
included filter can  also  have  includefilter  or  inputfilter  statements
itself: to avoid the risk of recursive calls resulting in an infinite loop,
the depth of included filters is limited. The default value for the maximal
depth is 2. This can be changed in the Filters Menu  Preferences  with  the
variable "Max Include Depth".<P>With a maximal depth of 2 you can have a structure of included filters like
this 
<PRE>
                        Main filter
                           /   \
                          /     \
                         /       \
                        /         \
                      fltA       fltB
                      /  \       /  \
                     /    \     /    \
                   fltC  fltD  fltE  fltF 
</PRE><P>If filters fltC, fltD, fltE  or  fltF  contain  include  statements,  these
statements will be ignored since they wil be at level 3 (unless  of  course
you set the "Max Include Depth" to 3 or more). You can put as many includes
as you want in a filter.<P>This technique can replace the use of multi filters. A multi  filter  could
be replaced by a main filter contain an includefilter command for  each  of
its components. The advantage is that they can be stored for later reuse.<P>The Temporary Filter can also be included as any other filter, like this:
<PRE>
 !!includefilter  Temporary Filter
</PRE>
 
<H3><A NAME="anchor14"></A> Caveat</H3>
It is very important that the arguments be separated  by  tabulations.  The
spaces, if any, will be considered as part of the strings. You can separate
the arguments with several tabulations : this will not confuse the  Filters
Menu and can be useful for a nice visual presentation of the filters.
The replacement string  can,  of  course,  be  empty.  In  this  case,  the
corresponding line in the filter will look like this
<PRE>
 searchString		[option]
</PRE>
(note that there are two tabs here between searchString and [option]).
If there is no option, the line will just be :
<PRE>
 searchString
</PRE><P>Beware of misinterpretations : if you write
<PRE>
 arg1  [tab]  [tab]  arg2
</PRE>
i-e two arguments separated by a double   tabulation,    this    will    be
interpreted as :
<UL>
	<LI> search String = arg1
	<LI> replacement string is empty
	<LI> options = arg2<P></UL><P>If this is NOT what you want you will have to precise the options and write
arg1  [tab]  [tab]  arg2  [tab]  options
which is equivalent to
<PRE>
 arg1  [tab]  arg2  [tab]  options
</PRE><P>Note that most of the built-in  filters  supplied  with  the  Filters  menu
convert character  entities;  for  example,  the  HtmlToLaTeX  filter  will
convert HTML entities such as 
<PRE>
 &euml;
</PRE>
to their LaTeX equivalent 
<PRE>
 \"{e}
</PRE>
These filters do not convert structural markup such as headers, paragraphs,
or blockquotes. But a filter like  ConvertHtmlToLatex  DOES  this  kind  of
things. <P>Here is now an example of filtering instructions
(see also the Example.flt filter) :
<PRE>
 LaTeX		Plain TeX	im
 (oz|cmac)TeX	\\TeX		1
 !! The following suppresses empty lines :
 ^$\r		1
 !! Replace tea by coffee (the 0 option can be omitted) :
 tea	coffee	0m
</PRE><P><H2><A NAME="anchor15"></A> Contributions</H2><P>I hope that in the future there will be contributions and that new  general
purpose filters will be added to the present collection. 
<P> Send me  an  e-mail  if  you  want  me  to  add  your  filters  to  the
distribution and/or to host them on my home   page    on    the    web    :

export the filtering capacity in other scripts. Just say
<PRE>
 alpha::package require filtersMenu 1.4
</PRE>
at the beginning of your script and then  use  one  of  the  following
commands 
<PRE>
     flt::filterThisFile $filtername $filename
     flt::filterThisSelection $filtername $selection
</PRE>
"filtername" is the name of the filter you want to apply (without  the
flt extension). If "filename" is not specified then it applies to  the
current window. "selection" is the name  of  a  variable  :  the  proc
flt::filterThisSelection returns the result of  filtering  applied  to
the contents of this variable.<P><H2><A NAME="anchor18"></A> Key Bindings</H2><P>There are a few easy to remember keybindings  "  la  emacs".  For  all  of
them you have to hit 'ctrl-f', release,  then  hit  one  of  the  following
letters :
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>'b'</TD><TD>to show the key bindings</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>'c'</TD><TD>to check the syntax</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>'t'</TD><TD>to call up the temporary filter</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>'w'</TD><TD>to filter the current window</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>
If you add the shift key with letters s, w, d,  f,  c  or  e  you  get  the
equivalent actions but with a Multifilter instead of a Filter. For instance
'ctrl-f shift-f' is equivalent to "apply multifilter to the  current  file"
and 'ctrl-f shift-c' will clear the multifilter.<P>'ctrl-f opt-e' edits the current filter.<P>There are three more key bindings to use the Temporary  Filter.  First  hit
'ctrl-t', release, then hit one of the letters s, w, d, f in order to apply
the temporary filter to a selection, to the current window, to a  directory
or to a fileset respectively.<P><H2><A NAME="anchor19"></A> Preferences</H2><P>The "Filters Prefs..." item in the "Packages" submenu of  the  "Config"  menu
allows you to make a few choices :
<UL>
	<LI> the "Warn Not Undoable" flag can be set to warn  you,  each  time
you apply a filter to a whole file, that it is an action  which  can't
be undone. Uncheck this box if you do not want to be warned.<P>	<LI> if the "Show Filter Syntax"  flag  is  set,  there  will  be  a  short
description of the filters syntax at the beginning of any new filter and of
the Temporary Filter window. Uncheck this box if you do not want it.<P>	<LI> the "Max Numb Err" variable designates the maximum  number  of  errors
tolerated when checking the syntax of a filter. If there are  more,  syntax
checking will be aborted after MaxNumbErr errors. Default value is 15.<P>	<LI> the "Max Before Scrap" variable designates the  maximum  length  of  a
selection above which filtering will be done  not  in  the  current  window
directly but in a scrap window. Using a scrap window is much faster, so you
should give this variable a small value. Default value is 70.<P>	<LI> the "ToggleSupSearch" flag allows filtering to run much faster by
deactivating superSearch (if present) during filtering operations  and
then immediatly reactivating. If unchecked, filtering will  be  slowed
down. This flag has no effect with Alpha8: it only applies to Alpha7.<P></UL><P><H2><A NAME="anchor20"></A> Version History</H2>

	<LI> 0.1b -- 00/04/18 -- First beta release. 
	<LI> 0.2b -- 00/04/19 -- Modified the procs to filter a selection: now

concerning future versions of AlphaTcl or AlphaTk. Suppressed the warning 
concerning superSearch since this latter has been modified. Made the scrap 
window "invisible" (off screen). Made the flt::substitute proc compatible 
with superSearch by toggling it forth and back (can't account for the 
incompatibility). Added a flag to toggle supersearch

	<LI> 1.3 -- 01/02/21 -- Modified the code internally to put all the

Streamlined the code. Added capacity of filtering a fileset. Filtering is 
now processed off-screen.<P></UL><P><H2><A NAME="anchor21"></A> Known problems</H2>
Note for Alpha7: 
Filters menu is MUCH faster (6 times!) when superSearch is NOT  active
due to the way each of them deals with its respective  tasks.  So  you
should better temporarily deactivate superSearch :  this  is  done  by
default with the "ToggleSupSearch" flag in the preferences. Unless you
have a very good reason, leave this flag set. If you leave superSearch
active, you should  then    unset,    in    its    preferences,    the
"beepOnFailedSearch" flag (introduced 05/03/2000) unless you  want  to
hear a beep symphony when applying a long filter to a file  containing
many unmatched strings. These remarks do not apply to Alpha8.<P>Please e-mail any problem or bug you encounter :
