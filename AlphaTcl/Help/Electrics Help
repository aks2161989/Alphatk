	  	Abstract


This file provides information on "Electric" behavior in Alpha.

The term "electric" is used throughout Alpha in the sense of

	automatic, power assisted behavior

which is intended to save time, keystrokes, and brainpower.  The basic idea is
that any one of several different keyboard shortcuts will scan the current
context surrounding the cursor and then insert the string that you really
want.  Other shortcuts might allow you to navigate an "electric template" that
might have been created.  You can specify which shortcuts are used for the
specific functions.

	  	Introduction


This help file describes all of the various packages that enable some sort of
"electric" behavior.  The primary goal of all of these packages is to save you
key strokes.

For example, when you press your key binding for "Complete" Alpha looks at the
text just prior to the cursor and attempts to determine if this 'hint' is an
abbreviation for some other desired text.  This completion might just be a
similar word found in the active window, or a special mode keyword that
inserts an electric template.

Another type of electric behavior is invoked by the "Expand" key binding.  In
this case, the preceding 'hint' is considered to be an acronym for some other
text that should be inserted, such as "sp --> someProcedure".

The "Complete" and "Expand" keyboard shortcuts can be adjusted in the dialog
created by selecting "Config > Special Keys".

Preferences: SpecialKeys

For the impatient reader: after determining your keyboard shortcut for
"Complete" you can click on this "Text Tutorial" hyperlink.  This opens an
interactive help window which explains the basic of electric completions.
Note that the "Installed Packages" help file includes a section containing
additional mode-specific completion tutorials -- these are also listed at the
end of the Text Tutorial.  Tutorials for the mode of the active window are
also available with "Config > Mode Prefs > Completions Tutorial".

Additional 'electric' features include the package: elecExpansions and the
package: elecCorrections, which have their own separate help.  In addition,
Alpha's default electric behavior can be enhanced if you activate the package:
betterTemplates, although you should probably read some of the sections below
so that "Better Templates" help will make more sense.

These hyperlinks:

  <<package::activate elecCorrections>>  "elecCorrections Help"
  <<package::activate betterTemplates>>  "betterTemplates Help"

will also temporarily activate these features for this editing session, select
"Config > Global Setup > Features" to turn them on permanently.

Preferences: Features


	====================================================================


	  	Electric Bindings


The "Config > Special Keys" dialog is used to define the keyboard shortcuts
which invoke the electric completion and expansion operations, as well as the
shortcuts used to jump between the template stops.

Preferences: SpecialKeys

This dialog includes items for the following functions:

	Clear All Stops
	Complete
	Expand
	Next Stop
	Next Stop Or Indent
	Prev Stop
	nth Stop

See the "# Template Insertions" section below for more information regarding
the navigation of templates and the "Elec Stop Marker".

The package: betterTemplates enhances these functions, treating all of the
template stops as a 'ring' and allowing you to navigate them with greater
precision.

This dialog also includes items for

	Real Tab
	Typewriter Tab

These are provided primarily because many users choose to use Tab to invoke
some item in the first list, and thus need some shortcut to insert a 'real'
tab!  The "Typewriter Tab" will just insert enough spaces to what would be the
next 'column' stop indicated visually by a 'real' tab.


	  	 	Indent On Return

Many modes have defined sophisticated indentation routines that is often
specific to the context surrounding the cursor position.  When this is the
case, the mode will have an "Indent On Return" preference that can be turned
on and off.  When it is turned on, pressing Return will automatically indent
the new line that is created.

Even if this preference is turned off, you can always indent the current line
using the "Text > Indent Line/Selection" menu commands.  In addition, pressing
Command-Return will always indent the new line, while Control-Return will
always insert a new line without indentation.

	  	 	Electric Braces

In many modes (especially those for computer languages) right and left braces
{} indicate some new block of code, and oftentimes this means that a new line
should be immediately inserted and/or some special indentation procedure
should take place.  When this is the case, the mode will have a preference
named "Electric Braces" defined.  When this preference is turned on, pressing
{ or } will perform some mode specific routine.  Pressing { or } with some
modifier key will insert a "normal" brace -- the modifier is often Control but
might vary according to your keyboard layout.

	  	 	Electric Semicolon

In many modes (especially those for computer languages) a semicolon indicates
the termination of a command line, and oftentimes this means that a new line
should be immediately inserted and/or some special indentation procedure
should take place.  When this is the case, the mode will have a preference
named "Electric Semicolon" defined.  When this preference is turned on,
pressing ; will perform some mode specific routine.  Pressing ; with some
modifier key will insert a "normal" semicolon -- the modifier is often Control
but might vary according to your keyboard layout.


	  	Electric Completions


AlphaTcl contains a unified collection of procedures to address command
completion, code indentation, electric-code generation, word completion and
related facilities, described below in "# Types Of Completions".

Here's a typical example from TeX mode.  You can type:

	for an explanation of this phenomenon,
	please refer to Fig
	
and then press "Complete".  This signifies that we should try to complete the
currently typed text.  In this case the completion might be:

	for an explanation of this phenomenon,
	please refer to Figure~\ref{fig-
	
If you hit "Complete" again, the completion routines try to search for TeX
'\labels' which begin with 'fig-' to insert the first such label it finds into
the text:

	for an explanation of this phenomenon,
	please refer to Figure~\ref{fig-heat-vs-time}
	
If this is the wrong one, you can keep hitting "Complete" until you reach the
correct completion:

	for an explanation of this phenomenon,
	please refer to Figure~\ref{fig-explanation}
	
Here's an example of using electric completions in C/C++ modes.  You type
'for', press "Complete" and then you get:

	for (;•;•){
		•
	}

This works at any current level of indentation, and the bullet marks '•' are
placemarkers.  You can just press the binding for "Next Stop" (or,
alternatively, "Indent Or Next Stop") to jump from one to the next.  These are
referred to as "template rings", and described in more detail in the section
"# Template Insertion" below.


	  	Electric Expansions


This package provides a method for expanding acronyms into full words.  When
you find yourself typing a lot of variable and function names over and over,
and these names are word-combinations where the name is formed by either
capitalizing each word or separating them with an underscore, you can type the
initial letter of each word and use the 'Expansion' keyboard shortcut to
invoke an acronym expansion.

See the package: elecExpansions help file for more information.


	  	Electric Corrections


This package helps check for and correct spelling mistakes or typos as you
type.  This is not a spell-checking extension -- instead it is more of a
"misspell-checker": you must teach Alpha the common misspellings or typos to
correct.  Whenever you press the return or space key, Alpha will then compare
the previous word to the list of all typos, and correct it if necessary.  This
package also includes a "Smart i" preference, which can automatically change
"i" to "I" as you type.

See the package: elecCorrections help file for more information.


	  	Electric Preferences

The "Config > Preferences > Interface Preferences > Electrics" dialog 
allows you to change Alpha's electric behavior.

Preferences: Electrics

Note: when the package: autoWrapComments is turned on, text that is typed in
in a commented line will be automatically wrapped even if the current "Wrap"
setting is "None".  If you don't like this behavior, you should turn off
"Auto Wrap Comments".

(More to be added...)


	====================================================================


	  	Types Of Completions


The "Complete" binding can perform a number of context specific routines to
complete a single word, offer a list of possible completions, insert a mode
specific template, etc.  which are explained below.

Completions types are listed in order of precedence, although individual
routines within the 'mode' specific completions will vary widely.


	  	 	User Defined Completions 

The "Config > Packages > Electric Completions" submenu contains several items
that allow you to create global completions that will be in place no matter
what mode you are in.  For example, you can turn

	vmd

into

	Vince M. Darley

automatically if desired or 

	www

into

	<http://www.santafe.edu/~vince/>

User completions are active in all modes, and take precedence over all other
completion types.


	  	 	Mode Specific Completions

Each mode can define a specific set of completion routines to be followed in a
specific order to create context specific completions.  The section below on
"# Possible Mode Completions" below explains what some of these completion
routines might do.

In some modes you can tell relatively easily from the context whether a
particular 'word' is a variable or procedure name or...  If different
completion procedures are useful for different types of word, then they are
checked next.  For instance, in Tcl mode, a word beginning with '$', or
preceded by 'set' or 'global' is a variable name.  It should therefore
preferentially be completed as a variable, rather than being expanded as a
command.  E.g.

	$str

should normally not be expanded to 

	$string ...

since it's clearly not the command 'string' that you are trying to type.

The variety of mode/context specific completions is unlimited.  Ideally, each
mode that creates a set of such routines also provides a completions tutorial
that explains them in more detail -- see the "Installed Packages" help file
for a list of tutorials currently available.


	  	 	Word Completions

If none of the above succeeded then the current word is completed to copy
nearby words (variable names) in the file.  Again, repeated presses will cycle
through other possibilities.


	  	Possible Mode Completions

Each mode can create its own set of completion routines, which will be queried
in whatever order the mode's maintainer thinks is most helpful.  Generally,
these take the context of the current 'word' into account, and perform a
series of tests to determine what you are attempting to accomplish.  If you
are in TeX mode, e.g, relevant questions include

  • Are we in the middle of 'contraction' ?
  • Are we starting an environment?
  • Is this a recognized TeX keyword?
  • Are we trying to complete some sort of reference?
  • Are we trying to complete some bibliographic citation?

Similarly, in C/C++ modes, we might want to figure out if

  • Is this the start of a recognized C/C++ keyword?
  • Do we have a template for this keyword?
  • Is this the start of a class?
	
The default completions package in the AlphaTcl core provide some of this
functionality, other procedures have been painstakingly developed by various
mode maintainers in the eternal process of spending an hour of programming in
order to later save 10 seconds of keystrokes :) Their labor has been spent to
make your text editing more efficient.

In all of the examples below, the procedure which is used to create the
completion is included mainly for developers that want to create mode specific
creations, as well as sample code.

Developers note: the array "completions" determines the order in which
completion routines are queried for each mode, as in

	ensureset completions(Tcl) {
		contraction Proc Vvar completion::cmd Ensemble completion::electric Var
	}

Some of these procs are defined in the "completion" namespace, others will be
specific to your mode.  See "TclCompletions.tcl" for examples.


	  	 	Command Completions 

Each mode can define a set of keywords that will always be completed first
regardless of how many similar surrounding words might be found.  These
commands might be then further completed with command templates.

For instance: in Tcl mode ("Tcl Example.tcl") you can type

	str

and  it will be completed to 

	string

and you will then be offered additional options (i.e. 'length' 'index' etc) in
a dialog that looks like <<Tcl::Completion::PickOption string>>.  If there are
multiple possibilities for the completion then the longest unique prefix is
inserted.
    
proc: completion::cmd

The available completions of this type are mode dependent, and stored in the
variable ${mode}cmds.  This variable must be a valid list, and must be stored
alphabetically.


	  	 	Code Templates

You can test these in the "C++ Tutorial.cc" tutorial window.

Type 

	for

in C mode and a complete template for code is generated:
	
	for (;•;•){
		•
	}

You can move from one template mark '•' to the next using your binding for
"Next Stop" or "Indent Or Next Stop".

proc: completion::electric

These are again mode dependent.  Each is stored individually as an element of
the array ${mode}electrics, so, for instance the above electric code is
generated by:

	set Celectrics(for) " (••;••;••)\{\n\t••\n\}\n••"

Note how the bullets are double in the definition.  You can actually place an
explanatory bit of text between pairs of bullets.  This is then used as a hint
to the user:

	set Celectrics(for) " (•start•;•test•;•increment•)\{\n\t•body•\n\}\n••"


	  	 	Class Names

You can test these in the "C++ Tutorial.cc" tutorial window.

In C++ mode, when entering a class definition, the class name occurs multiple
times.  To save entering all of these, this completion will fill them all in
for you.  For example, completing 'class' will insert:

	class •<object name> : public •<parent> {
	  public:
		•<object name>(•<args>);
		~•<object name>(void);
	
	};
	•

(Actual insertion might look different depending on whether you have activated
the package: betterTemplates, and the value of various prefs set and used by
that package.)

Now IF the "betterTemplates" package is active, type the class name, say
'toaster', followed by "Complete".  This will result in:

	class toaster : public •<parent> {
	  public:
		toaster(•<args>);
		~toaster(void);
	
	};
	•

i.e. each occurrence of the electric stop 'object name' has been filled in
correctly.  This feature may be easily extended to more complex examples.
This completion uses the proc: C::Completion::Class


	  	 	File-names

Useful for Shel mode, this allows you to type a partial directory or filename
and hit "Complete" to have it extended as much as possible.

proc: completion::filename


	  	 	TeX References

You can test these in the "TeX Tutorial v1.3.tex" tutorial window.

Type 

	\ref

and the command is automatically completed with the name of a nearby \label{},
as in

	\ref{eq::someEquation}

Repeated "Complete" keypresses will cycle through all \label's.  Further,
these commands chain together, so typing

	\eqr

will complete the \eqref and continue to fill in a nearby label!

Note that the reference completions can be instigated by command completion
on, 'Fig' 'Chap' 'Eq.'  'Sec', ...  which insert the standard label prefix
'fig:' 'chap:' 'eq:' 'sec:' as appropriate.  If you complete with no prefix,
then any label will match; if you have a prefix then only those which match
will be suggested.

This is implemented by the proc: TeX::Completion::Reference


	  	 	TeX Citations

Type 

	\cite{Darley19

and the command is completed with a matching citation entry from one of your
'.bib' database files.  If there are multiple possibilities, then you are
prompted with a list from which to choose.  Depending upon the value of a TeX
flag, the list can include the titles of each choice, making it more obvious
to you which is correct.

This is implemented by the proc: TeX::Completion::Cite


	  	 	TeX Environments

\begin{} \end{} pairs with synchronization of the parameter, and template
generation of the body.

You can complete 

	\begin

followed by 'equ' and another "Complete to insert the following:

	\begin{equation}
		•
		\label{eq:•}
	\end{equation}
	•

You have a choice between the double-completion, as above, or just 

	\begin{equation}

followed by "Complete" which will do the job in one go.

This is implemented by the proc: TeX::Completion::Env

Similar things work for 'itemize' 'enumerate' etc.  Of particular use are the
completions for 'figure' environments, from which you can enter ordinary
figures, floating figures, and a large number of sub-figure configurations (2
figures side-by-side, a block of 4,...).  For instance, a handful of
key-presses will give you this:

	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\subfigure[•“subfig caption”]{\label{fig:•}%
			\includegraphics[width=\figstwo]{•“graphics file”}}\goodgaptwo
		\subfigure[•“subfig caption”]{\label{fig:•}%
			\includegraphics[width=\figstwo]{•“graphics file”}}\\
		\subfigure[•“subfig caption”]{\label{fig:•}%
			\includegraphics[width=\figstwo]{•“graphics file”}}\goodgaptwo
		\subfigure[•“subfig caption”]{\label{fig:•}%
			\includegraphics[width=\figstwo]{•“graphics file”}}%
		\caption•“[short caption for t.o.f.]”{•“caption”}
		\label{fig:•}
	\end{figure}
	•

For these to work, you must use the correct LaTeX packages in the .tex file
(graphics, floatingfigure or subfigure as appropriate, although the code will
automatically insert the correct 'usepackage' specifications for you if
desired), and you may need the following definitions in your LaTeX preamble:

	\newlength{\goodspace}
	\newlength{\goodspacethree}
	\newlength{\goodspacefour}
	\newlength{\figstwo}
	\newlength{\figsthree}
	\newlength{\figsfour}
	
	\setlength{\goodspace}{\subfigtopskip+\subfigbottomskip}
	\setlength{\goodspacethree}{\goodspace}
	\setlength{\goodspacefour}{\goodspace*\real{0.6}}
	
	\newcommand{\goodgap}{\hspace{\goodspace}}
	\newcommand{\goodgaptwo}{\goodgap}
	\newcommand{\goodgapthree}{\hspace{\goodspacethree}}
	\newcommand{\goodgapfour}{\hspace{\goodspacefour}}
	
	\setlength{\figstwo}{(\linewidth-\goodspace)/2-1pt}
	\setlength{\figsthree}{(\linewidth-\goodspace *2)/3-1pt}
	\setlength{\figsfour}{(\linewidth-\goodspace *\real{1.8})/4-1pt}

These allow good alignment and spacing for most subfigure combinations without
the need for manual intervention.

Some environments can contain an arbitrary number of items.  In this case,
hitting use the "TeX Menu > Environments > Add Item" (or its key binding) to
(surprise) add an item.  Here we turn this:

	\begin{description}
		\item[First one] here's the description
		
		\item[•“name”] •“description”
		
	\end{description}
	•

into:

	\begin{description}
		\item[First one] here's the description
		\item[•] •
		
		\item[•“name”] •“description”
		
	\end{description}
	•

Similar entries work correctly for itemized, enumerated, aligned,...
environments.


	  	 	Tcl Variables, Procedures

During Tcl completions, the context surrounding the 'hint' is checked to
determine if you are attempting to complete a proc, array, or scalar variable.
If this context can be determined, then you will be offered a list based on
the procs/vars that are currently recognized by your Tcl interpreter.  These
completions are also namespace aware, so that if the context looks like

	proc alpha::testSomething {
	    
	    set specialVar [findAll
		
	}

you will be offered a list of all procedures in the 'alpha' namespace that
start with 'findAll'.  If no such completions exist, then all procedures in
the global namespace starting with 'findAll' will be presented.

proc: Tcl::Completion::Proc
proc: Tcl::Completion::GlobalVar

Tcl variables are often referenced with '$var' or just 'var' or '${var}'.  You
can complete between any of these types.  A local search for a match is done
and the closest match inserted.  Again you can cycle through other matches
with "Complete".

proc: Tcl::Completion::Var

Take the "Tcl Tutorial.tcl" for more information.


	  	 	Tcl Ensemble Completions 

Type 

	string co

in Tcl mode and this is can be completed to 

	string compare

along with an electric template is inserted for the arguments of this two part
command.  Useful for any case in which the word before last is the command,
and the word just before is part of a refinement of that command, in any
situation for which a number of further arguments will be filled in.

(Note that in Tcl mode, all defined procedures currently recognized by your
Tcl interpreter can be included as completions, and in this case 'co' will
probably first be recognized as as standard 'co' completion and you will be
offered a list of completions that have nothing to do with 'string'.)

proc: completion::ensemble

This procedure does a double-word check, and 


	  	Template Insertions

You'll notice in a lot of the above examples that only bullets '•' are
inserted into the text.  You can set the 'Elec Stop Marker' preference to
change this character if desired.

Preferences: Completions

Many of the routines in mode completion routines allow you to insert templates
for 'for' loops, '\begin...\end environments', file headers, function
comments, and even entire documents.  Once a template has been inserted, it
will often contain several 'place-markers' or 'template-stops' at each of
which you will most likely wish to enter some text/code.

Here's an example of a 'for' template in C++ mode (created just by typing
'for' and then pressing the "Complete" key):

	for (•<init>;•<test>;•<increment>){
		•<loop body>
	}
	•

You can jump backwards and forwards amongst these stops using the keyboard
shortcuts defined for these operations.  Consult the "# Electric Bindings"
section above for more information.

If the package: betterTemplates has been turned on, you have a choice between
four different formats for the visual appearance of the template stops.  They
are usually signified by a bullet '•', but more elaborate methods are
supported.  These templates may be nested without any extra effort on your
part.  You can also choose the colour of the bullets / prompts which are
inserted.

	  	The Electric Menu


The "Electric Menu" is has been designed to be globally activated -- you can
turn it on using "Config > Global Setup > Menus".

Preferences: Menus

To temporarily activate it now in order to inspect its contents while reading
this help file, click here <<package::activate electricMenu>>.  This will
create the menu and insert it at the end of the main menu bar.  Click here
<<package::deactivate electricMenu>> to remove it.


	  	 	Electric Menu Preferences


This menu create four new preferences -- that determine how the Electric menu
will be built, depending on how it will be used.  The first three appear in
the "Config > Preferences > Interface Prefs > Electrics" dialog:

Preferences: Electrics

	Put Templates In Main Menu

To put all the templates into the main electric menu rather than in a submenu,
turn this item on.  To place all templates in a sub-menu of the electric menu,
turn this item off.

The electric menu contains a 'Templates' sub-menu, which contains global
templates stored in the variable 'univ::MenuTemplates', and mode-specific
templates stored in variables ${mode}Templates.  The format of these variables
is a list of names, which correspond to procedures when prepended with
'file::'.  You can add new items by using the menu item.


	Show Electric Keys In Menu

To add the list of key-bindings to the bottom of the electric menu (these are
the items you set using "Config > Special Keys" as described above in the
section "# Special Keys") turn this item on.  To remove the list of
key-bindings from the electric menu, once you've learned them all, you can
turn this item off.

Preferences: SpecialKeys

	Add Template Manipulators

To add a couple of menu items to let you create or delete new templates, turn
this item on, otherwise leave it off.  Once you have activated the menu, use
this hyperlink <<dialog::preferences preferences Electrics>> to change the
value of these preferences to see how this changes the appearance of the menu.


The last one appears in the "Interface Prefs > Completions" dialog:

Preferences: Completions

	Show Completions In Electric Menu

To show mode-dependent electric completions in menu, i.e. include in the menu
all items which when typed and followed by "Complete" will complete into some
command, turn this item on.  By default all items in the ${mode}electrics
array are inserted into a new menu.  This allows you to insert them, and get a
feel for a small number of the completions which exist.  (The electric
template inserted for any item appearing in this menu could also be created by
typing the item name into the active window and using the "Complete" key
bindings.)

To remove all mode-dependent completions from the electric menu, once you've
learned everything that's available, you can turn this item off.  Use this
hyperlink <<dialog::preferences preferences Completions>> to change the value
of this preference.  (You probably need to change modes in order to see the
difference, try opening this "Perl Example.pl" window to see what happens.

	  	Feedback

Help us to help you!

Completions for some common items just don't currently exist.  So if you try
to complete something and it doesn't work, why not write a completion for it?
Once you have assembled a few, mail them to the current maintainer of the
"Elec Completions" package.  (Suggestions should preferably archived in .sit
or .zip files, since bullets '•' generally don't travel well by ASCII mail).
We'd particularly like completions for other modes.
