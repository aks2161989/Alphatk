This file describes the known bugs as of this release, as well as how to file
new bug reports.

(Note that in this file, as in most Help files, "Alpha" refers to the family
of application binaries that use the AlphaTcl library, including all of
Alpha8, AlphaX, and Alphatk.  The venerable Alpha7 is also in this family,
but has now been retired.  All current development is devoted to the new
generation of Alpha editors.)

Alpha has a sophisticated bug-tracking database named "Alpha-Bugzilla" in
which all of the bugs described in this file are stored.  Please use it,
since it will help us (and you) to keep track of bugs, potential workarounds,
and when they are finally fixed.  To use the system, go to

<http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/bugzilla/>.

See the "Alpha-Bugzilla Help" window for more information about this system,
and how to use Alpha's <<reportABug>> interface to file new bugs.

If you're looking at this file wondering whether to report a bug, you might
want to take a look at the "# Most Frequently Reported" bugs listed below.
If you want to try to track down the cause of your bug before reporting it,
please see the "Debugging Help" file.

	  	Introduction


As you might have noticed, Alpha is never entirely bug-free.  There is a
dedicated corps of volunteers, however, who spend way too much of their spare
time working on improving both the core Alpha binaries as well as the
AlphaTcl library in which most of Alpha's core functionality lies.

Once you've finished reading this file, you can click on this hyperlink
<<reportABug>> to generate a new bug report.  This item is always available
by selecting the "Help > Report A Bug" menu item.

The AlphaDev menu has a submenu named "Alpha Bugzilla" which has several
items that provide a handy interface with bugzilla -- click on this hyperlink
<<floatBugzillaMenu>> to see the items available.

The alphatcl-developers/users mailing lists are also a useful venue for
discussion possible problems/workarounds/bugs in Alpha.  (See the "Readme"
file for links to mailing list information.)  However for the highest
likelihood of getting a bug fixed, the bugzilla system should be used.  It
maintains a public record of what has been done to fix the problem, and
e-mails directly to the alphatcl-developers list as bugs are reported and
fixed.  You can always pose a question to the mailing list first to ask if an
actual bug report should be filed, and you could even submit the report
generated by <<reportABug>> to the list to help clarify your question, but
the bugzilla system is your best bet for getting a problem addressed.

Bugs in Alpha are generally of two types: a problem in Alpha's compiled C
code, or in Alpha's supporting libraries of Tcl code.  The latter can usually
be fixed more easily.  In either case it is essential that you provide a
detailed sequence of actions which can reproduce the problem.


	  	Reporting A Bug


Here are the steps you need to take, questions that you must answer in order
to produce a useful bug report:

¥ Can this bug be replicated?

  Try to find a 100% reproducible set of circumstances which show up the bug,
  which hopefully don't depend on your particular machine's configuration.
  If you cannot describe these circumstances so that someone will be able to
  replicate it, chances are very good that it will never get fixed.

¥ Does Alpha crash or does Alpha simply do something a little wrong?

  If it crashes, use the bugzilla bug reporting system to enter all pertinent
  information.  The bug will be recorded, and we will try to fix it.  On the
  other hand, if Alpha does not crash, you will have to do more to produce
  the most valuable bug reports, so keep reading...

¥ Do you have the most recent version of Alpha and AlphaTcl?

  The AlphaTcl Home Page <http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/wiki/> lists the most
  current versions available.  You can find out your current version numbers
  by looking at your "Installed Packages" help file.

¥ Is the bug documented in the "# Known Bugs" section of this file?  

  If so it is a known bug which will hopefully be fixed in the future.

If you got this far, you have the latest public release of Alpha(Tcl) and
have a reproducible set of circumstances in which Alpha doesn't do quite what
you want.  Please read further (or perform a keyword search in this file) to
see if the bug has already been reported.  If not, you can use this hyperlink
<<reportABug>> to generate a new bug report -- take a look at the help for
the package: reportABug for more information about generating a bug report
using Alpha rather than bugzilla's web interface.

If you want to try to track down the cause of your bug before reporting it,
please see the "Debugging Help" file.


	  	Making A Suggestion


Alpha-Bugzilla is also an invaluable tool for keeping track of all activity
related to Requests For Enhancemet (RFEs).  You can make a suggestion to
improve any aspect of Alpha's functionality by filing a "bug report" -- there
is a special "severity" field named "enhancement" that is used to distinguish
such requests from "true" bugs.

The menu item "Help > Make A Suggestion" will guide you through a series of
dialogs to create a new RFE -- or you can click here: <<makeASuggestion>>.

A list of all current "# Requests For Enhancement" are listed below.


	  	Help Us Help You


Keep in mind that all of the AlphaTcl developers are volunteers, and are not
compensated in any way.  Bug reports that are friendly, coherent, and
complete will be much better received -- any amount of time that is spent by
the developer tracking down needed information is time not spent on actually
addressing the bug.  Providing developers with complete information from the
outset will always lead to a quicker resolution of the issue/bug that you are
currently experiencing.

Note that "Alpha" might refer to Alpha8, AlphaX, or Alphatk throughout the
documentation.  Always identify which program you are using, your OS, and all
"# Version Numbers" associated with this product.  Perhaps the most annoying
comment is "this doesn't work" -- it is much more useful to report what does
happen, including any status bar messages or alert dialog information.  (If
there are no messages or dialogs, state that explicitly.)  Following these
guidelines will help reduce the number of posts/questions required to address
and fix the problem.

The <<reportABug>> utility will lead you step by step through a series of
dialogs extracting various bits of information required to file a report that
can be properly logged.  Without this information, it is nearly impossible to
keep track of these bugs.

IMPORTANT: Various users have commented in the past that the bugzilla
reporting system is cumbersome, unwieldy, etc.  Unless you have some
constructive suggestions to improve this system, please refrain from
criticizing what is currently in place -- such comments will only irritate
the person from whom you are asking for help.

Not all bugs have an immediate solution available.  Some bugs have been in
the database for years (seriously) waiting for the proper fix.  As of this
writing there are more than 1,800 bugs in the database, and while many have
yet to be addressed none of them have been lost.


	====================================================================


	  	Known Bugs

(As of 03/01/2006, for AlphaTcl 8.1a4, Alpha8/X 8.1a1, Alphatk 8.4a2)

These bug reports were created using the menu item in the AlphaDev menu named
"Alpha Bugzilla > Summary Bug Lists".  Most of these items will open a new
browser window containing the results for the given queries.  (Click on this
<<floatBugzillaMenu>> hyperlink to see the menu items.)

(AlphaTcl developers note: see the "# Notes on this file" section below for
more information on how these summary lists were created, and ideas for future
directions.)

All of the hyperlinks below will open the bug report in your local browser.
They are listed in order of severity (the second column), in which the
abbreviations stand for

	blo     "blocker"
	cri     "critical"
	maj     "major"
	nor     "normal"
	min     "minor"
	tri     "trivial"
	enh     "enhancement"
	faq     "faq"

These bugs are also categorized by bugzilla "product" categories.

The "Changes - Alpha" "Changes - Alphatk" and "Changes - AlphaTcl" help files
contain summaries of all recent changes -- it's possible that the bug is
mentioned there, with information about partial or complete fixes.  We do our
best to mention bugs with their bugzilla database number, though you can't
always count on that being true.

	  	Version Numbers

Whenever you are reporting a bug, either in a formal bug report or to one of
the mailing lists described in the "Readme # Internet resources" file, you
should include the version numbers of Alpha and other packages which you are
using.  If they are not the latest you should consider upgrading first too.
(If you use the <<reportABug>> procedure to generate the report, this
information will be automatically included at the bottom of the report.)

To determine the version information for your installation, you can open the
"Installed Packages" help file and click on the <<global::listPackages>>
hyperlink to rebuild it.  Current version information will then be listed at
the top of this window.

It is usually worth checking if there is a newer release available: the
problem may already have been fixed.  The "Help > AlphaTcl Home Page" menu
item will open a url in your local browser; the latest versions are always
announced there.


	  	Notes on this file

After using the "Alpha Bugzilla > Summary Bug Lists" menu item to create
summary bug lists for the products listed above, I used the "Change Columns"
hyperlink to only list the fields that appear above.  I then saved this
browser window as a text file, and reformatted it using a couple of simple
editing macros.  It would be nice to create a Tcl script to interface with
Bugzilla (i.e. the proc: bugzilla::listOpenBugs) to return these results
formatted for inclusion here, but I'm not sure that the current Bugzilla
implementation is able to do this for us yet.
