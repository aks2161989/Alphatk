	  	Introduction

Alpha is a powerful, multi-modal, highly configurable, and programmable text
editor.  For basic editing you can probably rely on your experience from
other text editors or word processors, but in order to take advantage of the
power-user features you will sooner or later want to dive into Alpha's vast
documentation.  This 'Readme' briefly surveys Alpha's documentation and help
system, and points to other resources.  Please see the "Release Notes" help
file for a list of the major recent changes and known limitations.

	  	General Help files

Most of Alpha's help files can be accessed from the Help Menu, right-most in
the menu bar.  To get an idea of some of Alpha's capabilities, peruse the
"Examples Help" file.  For general help, there is a detailed "Alpha Manual",
and a rather shorter "Quick Start" document.  The other help files are more
specialized.  Some help files are also available in html or pdf format.  Html
formatted help files can also be read with Alpha's html renderer.

Preferences: Help


	  	Mode specific help
	       
Alpha automatically enters a "mode" specific to the sort of document being
edited, and many features are mode dependent.  For example, in HTML mode there
are special menus with all sorts of fancy tools for editing html documents,
and the text is automatically colored according to the html syntax to make it
easier to read.  

Alpha determines the mode from the file name extension (e.g. .html); otherwise
you can change mode manually by selecting "Config > Mode Prefs > Change Mode".
For help on mode-specific issues, consult the mode help file --- pressing
Control-Help opens the help file for the active mode.  Selecting the menu item
"Config > Mode Prefs > Describe Mode" will provide more technical information
regarding the mode.

Many modes allow you to customize their behavior by setting "Mode Prefs",
which can be accessed through "Config > Mode Prefs > Preferences".  These
dialogs generally include a "Help" button that describes the individual
preferences.

Preferences: Mode


	  	Package specific help

Much of Alpha's functionality is implemented as 'packages', which can be
turned on and off in "Config > Global Setup > Features", where you can also
obtain short descriptions of the individual features.

Preferences: Features

See the "Installed Packages" file for a list of pre-installed packages in
Alpha, with hyperlinks to their documentation.  For other packages, check
this web page:

    <http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/wikipages/new-packages>

The "Config > Packages" menu contains items for "Describe a Package" and "Read
Help for a Package".  Selecting either of these will open a dialog allowing
you to select the package for which you want more information.


	  	Keyboard shortcuts (key bindings)

Alpha is very rich in keyboard shortcuts: some of them are displayed in the
menus, but there are many others.  It is also easy to define your own keyboard
shortcuts for any menu item, or for any action or script.  The help file
"Keyboard Shortcuts" describes Alpha's preset shortcuts, and contains more
information on how to define your own.  The preset key bindings adjust to
keyboard layout --- currently you have to tell Alpha about your keyboard
layout, in "Config > Preferences > System Preferences > International".

Preferences: International


	  	Internet resources
	      
For the most recent, up-to-date, information about Alpha, and further 
resources, see "The Alpha Wiki" at

    <http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/wiki> .

Alpha is privileged by an active and helpful user community whose main
communication channels are two mailing lists you are invited to subscribe 
to, for "users" and "developers".  Go to

    <http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/mail>

to search the archives or to sign up.

The developers' list is for discussing technical issues, while the users'
list is for all sorts of questions and hints --- it is read also by the
developers.  Questions are usually answered within a day, and often they lead
to improvements in subsequent versions of Alpha and its documentation.  You
can also use the "Help > Search E-mail Archives" menu item to see if a
particular issue has been discussed.


	  	Bug reporting 
	    
There are still a number of known bugs, and probably many which have not yet
been discovered.  Bug reports are very welcome.  PLEASE read the help file
"Known Bugs" for a list of known bugs, and for information regarding how to
make your bug report sufficiently informative to allow the developers to
identify and fix the bug.  Alpha has a sophisticated bug reporting and
tracking system at

    <http://www.purl.org/net/alpha/bugzilla/> .

It allows to keep track of all information related to a bug, workarounds,
dependence, and solutions.  The preferred method for submitting a new bug to
this system is through "Help > Report A Bug" menu item.
