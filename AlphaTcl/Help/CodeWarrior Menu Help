					Abstract

This is a help file for the "Code Warrior Menu" in Alpha. For Alpha to find
it, you must move this file to the "Help" folder located at the same  level
as the Alpha application itself.

1. Introduction
This menu is designed to let   you    interact    with    the    Metrowerks
CodeWarrior(tm) program. You can develop your C/C++ project  in  Alpha  and
control most of CodeWarrior actions from within  Alpha  :  compile,  build,
run, preprocess, disassemble, export,  touch,  update,  precompile,  switch
between projects or between targets in a project, get all kinds of info and
much more without leaving Alpha.
 

1.1. Setting the menu
Alpha/CodeWarrior interaction does not need any setup beyond activating the
menu. The CodeWarrior menu can be added or removed as a global menu via the
menu item 
    "Config --> Global Setup --> Menus" 
but the best way to use it is to link it to C and C++ modes  so  that  each
time a file is opened in  one  of  these  modes  the  CodeWarrior  menu  is
automatically installed : to do this, switch to C or C++  mode  and  select
the menu item 
    "Config --> Mode Prefs --> Menus"
In the dialog window check the  "CodeWarrior  menu"  checkbox.  That's  all
there is to it.

Alpha's support is implemented entirely in Tcl, Alpha's macro language. The
code can be found in two files : 
"codeWarriorMenu.tcl" and "codeWarriorCompletions.tcl". 
The CodeWarrior menu items are explained below.

1.2. External Editor
CodeWarrior now has support for external editors.  Metrowerks CodeWarrior
supports the notion of an "External Editor".  To use Alpha as such:
 

   1. Create a folder called (Helper Apps) (with the curly  braces)  in  the
same directory as the IDE if it does not already exist.

   2. Place an alias to Alpha in this {Helper Apps} folder. Call this  alias
"External Editor".

   3. Check the "External Editor" flag in the Metrowerks preferences  dialog
(IDE Extras panel). Alternatively you can set this flag from Alpha with the
corresponding flag 'Use External Editor' in the Werks Flags submenu.


1.3. Code Warrior projects
For the interaction  to  work  correctly  between  your  source  files  and
CodeWarrior, there must be a project opened in CodeWarrior and  the  source
file must belong to the project. There is a menu item called "Add File"  to
add the currently opened source file to the current project.  If  you  hold
the option key down this menu item  becomes  "Remove  File"  and  lets  you
remove the file from the project.
 Several projects can be opened at a time : the interaction always takes
place with the frontmost one. You can easily switch between  projects  with
the "Select Project..." menu item. Within a  project,  you  switch  between
targets with the "Select Target..." menu item.
 CodeWarrior menu always checks, when necesary, that a project is opened
or that your file belongs to the current target and warns you  in  case  of
problem. 

1.4. Errors
All of the functions that cause compilation to take place return any errors
in a window called "* Compiler Errors *". Individual errors can be selected
by using the up and down arrow keys. Return/Enter is used to bring  up  the
offending file at the correct line.

2. Description of the menu items



<Switch To Ide>
Switch to CodeWarrior app.

<Werks Flags>
Specify compiling, building or linking options. Options available are :
 Build Before Running         
 Play Sound After Updt & Make 
 Save Open Files Before Build 
 Use External Editor          
 Activate Browser             
 Activate C++ Compiler        
 Enable Objective C           
 Enable C++ Exceptions        
 Enable RunTime Type Info     
 Generate Link Map            
 Generate Sym File            
 Invert Debugger              
 Switch When Compiling        
Note that the  flag  "Invert  Debugger"  was  previously  improperly  named
"Enable Debugger": it acts in fact like a toggle. If you set this  flag  in
Alpha but the debugger is already enabled in CW, then this  _disables_  the
debugger when you run your built project from Alpha : this is a feature  or
a bug (?) resulting from the corresponding CW Apple Event (param DeBg).

The "Save Open Files Before Build" flag is available since CW 6.


<Select Project...>
Brings up a dialog with a list  of  all  the  open  projects.  The  current
project is the one selected in the list: it corresponds  to  the  frontmost
one in CodeWarrior. To switch to another target, select it and click OK. 


<Select Target...>
Brings up a dialog with a list of all the targets in the  current  project.
The current target is the one selected in the list. To  switch  to  another
target, select it and click OK.

<Add File>
Add current file to the current project.

When holding the option key down :

<Remove File>
Remove current file from the current project.


<Touch>
Declare frontmost window as modified in current target.

<Compile>
Compile frontmost window.


When holding the option key down :

<Compile Files>
Compile all windows in the same mode as the frontmost window.


<Check Syntax>
Check syntax of frontmost window.

<Preprocess>
Preprocess the current file : resulting window is opened in IDE.

<Disassemble>
Disassemble the current file. This file  must  belong  to  a  target  in  a
project and must have been compiled already. To edit the dump file in Alpha
open the CodeWarrior menu with the option key down. The "Disassemble"  item
becomes "Edit Dump in Alpha".


When holding the option key down :

<Edit Dump in Alpha>
The dump file resulting from a Disassemble command will be  saved  on  disk
and opened in Alpha. Not available in versions of CW prior to 6.


<Precompile Header...>
Prompt user for destination and compile frontmost window to destination. 
Destination must already exist.

<Update>
Update current project.

<Make>
Make current project.

<Run>
Run current project.

<Remove Object Code>
Remove all compiled object codes from the current target.

<Reset Entry Paths>
Reset the entry paths in the current project.

<Export Project>
Export the project file as an XML file (not available in  old  versions  of
CodeWarrior). The output file is named  after  the  project  file  plus  an
'.xml' extension. It is created in the same  folder  as  the  project  file
itself. Not available in versions of CW prior 6.

<Open Resource>
Open a resource file belonging to the project with  the  application  which
created it (Constructor, ResEdit etc.) If there are several resource files,
the proc displays a picklist to choose one.

<Open Include>
Open the file #include'd on this line (also can be invoked by
command-double-clicking).

<Header & Source>
This item attempts to edit the header file corresponding  to  a  particular
source file and vice-versa. It looks only in the same folder as the current
file (this should certainly be improved). It considers that a  header  file
has an extension starting with the letter h and  a  source  file  with  the
letter c.


<Headers>
This submenu allows you to set your own searching paths which will be  used
by Alpha when attempting to open an included file.

<Debugging>


<Go to Debugger>
Launch the MetroWerks debugger  (makes  sense  only  for  old  versions  of
CodeWarrior when the debugger was separate).

<Set Breakpoint>
Set a breakpoint at the current line of the frontmost window.

<Clear Breakpoint>
Clear a breakpoint at the current line of the frontmost window.

<Next Error>
Display next error.

<Prev Error>
Display previous error.

<Show in IDE>
Open file in IDE and show the current line of the frontmost window  in  the
debugger.

<Edit Link Map>
Edit the .xMAP file corresponding to the current target. The proc looks for
.xMAP files in  the  project's  output  folder  and  displays  a  picklist.
CodeWarrior produces a link map only if the 'Generate Link Map' flag is set
on. See the "Werks Flags" submenu above.




<Inspectors>

<File Inspector>
Brings info about the current source file.

<Target Inspector>
Brings info about the current target.

<Project Inspector>
Brings info about the current project.

<Link Order>
Edit the list of all source files in the current  project  in  the  linking
order.

<Non Simple Classes>
Edit the list of all non simple classes in a  C++  project.  This  supposes
that your project has been built succesfully otherwise CodeWarrior won't be
able to return this piece of info.

<Class Info...>
Brings info about a specific non  simple  class  in  a  C++  project.  This
supposes that the info is available in CodeWarrior which is not always  the
case. The project must at least  have  been  built  succesfully.  The  info
returned is a list of base  classes  from  which  the  specified  class  is
derived,  of  all  data  memebers  and  all  member  functions  with  their
properties. 


<Class Browser...>
Open in IDE a browser window about a specified class.



<Global Prefs>
Each item in this submenu allows you to retrieve and edit (but not to  set)
the global preferences chosen in the corresponding panel in CodeWarrior. To
get all the  global  preferences,  choose  the  menu  item  "All  Globals".
Available panels are:
Build Settings      Layout Editor    
Debugger Display    MetroNub Panel   
Debugger Global     Plugin Settings  
Extras              Shielded Folders 
Font                Syntax Coloring  
Global Source Trees VCS Setup        


<Target Prefs>
Each item in this submenu allows you to retrieve and edit (but not to  set)
the target-specific  preferences  chosen  in  the  corresponding  panel  in
CodeWarrior. To get all the target-specific preferences,  choose  the  menu
item "All Panels". Available panels are:
Access Paths      PPC Linker          
Build Extras      PPC PEF             
C-C++ Compiler    PPC Project         
Custom Keywords   PPCAsm Panel        
File Mappings     Rez Compiler        
MacOS Merge Panel Runtime Settings    
Output Flags      Target Settings     
PPC Disassembler  Target Source Trees 


<Create Fileset>
Create a fileset containing all text files in the project currently  opened
in CodeWarrior. See the 'Filesets Help' file for more info  about  filesets
in Alpha.

<Help>
Edit this Help file.
