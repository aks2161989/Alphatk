= Alphatk change log						
================================================================================ 

Please note that a large part of Alphatk's functionality is implemented
in the 'AlphaTcl' core libraries.  For changes to that code, please see
the help file "Changes - AlphaTcl".  Usually AlphaTcl changes at a
faster rate than the Alphatk core.

  This only really impacts Diff mode, which should be improved as a
  result.

  the annoying keybinding errors we see.  May still need a few tweaks,
  but the basic problem is solved in a much more satisfactory way.
¥ added optional arguments -w -font -fontsize -tabsize to 'setFontsTabs'

  with:
  regModeKeywords -a -s green -q \$ \$ TeX {}
¥ updated tclAE, vfs, Memchan extensions for MacOS X.
¥ MacOS X.  On Jaguar, the enclosed Tk.framework contains Unicode font
  handling/rendering (thanks Benny) and a native alert dialog (thanks
  Mats), and multiline text widget search routes (from me!). These 
  changes will eventually propagate to the official Tk distributions.
¥ routed bgerrors through AlphaTcl's error handling mechanisms.

¥ printing fix (blank lines)
¥ further improvement to 'text_cmd' and 'text_cmds' so they apply to
  the correct windows, even when new windows are in the process of

  mailing list).
¥ added versions of icOpen and icGetPref from Craig.
¥ enhanced getWinInfo to agree with Alpha 8.
¥ don't bother trying to colour extremely long lines properly.
¥ activateHook can't be called recursively any more. Makes for saner
  behaviour in some strange circumstances.

  between Alphatk and Alpha 8/X.

8.2d1 released 	   	   last update: 04/10/2002 {12:03:39 PM}

¥ added support for 'the mark' -- yank, exchange point and mark etc.
  (thanks Craig, Mark).
¥ provided user-control over balloon help delays (see Prefs->Help).
¥ first implementation of rectangular selection.  This work using

  segments.
¥ fix to bug on MacOS X with setting of platform key-bindings.

¥ lots of small changes which should make things run better on MacOS 
  X.
¥ fix to problem with update and moving of status bar on the fly.
¥ early prefs (e.g. status bar position) now saved in a more
  consistent fashion.  A side-effect is a temporary loss of the old
  value of these preferences (just set them again and all will be
  fine).
¥ contextual menus now supported.  Right-click now mapped to
  contextual menu and Alt-right-click is the path popup (which used
  to be accessed with right-click).
¥ fixed some odd line-ending issues, and the root cause of the
  problem in supersearch.
¥ better indentation in C, C++, Java modes.
¥ fix to saveAs of read-only windows not properly enabling the
  window.
¥ suspendHook is called at appropriate times -- this should work

  can't capture the fact that it hasn't lost the focus.
¥ allow balloon help to be turned off completely.

  ensure proper recolouring of the window.
¥ some improvements to dialog, listpick dealing with selection and
  key-bindings.  You can now use 'return/tab/shift-tab' as expected

  add the 'control' key.
¥ added alt-x/c/v bindings in dialogs.
¥ vcs, marks, funcs menus are now both built and controlled entirely 
  from AlphaTcl.

  line numbers in windows, keyboard macros, drag'n'drop support 
  (using the tkdnd extension) in dialogs, better encoding support.
¥ improved text::color
¥ the newly updated WWW menu provides excellent 'lynx-like' web
  browsing within Alphatk (thanks Craig!).
¥ fix to v. rare colouring problem which could particularly occur in
  latex mode.
¥ colouring will work more effectively for non-frontmost windows.
¥ improved storage of hypers in window so they are correctly
  cleaned up (also required change to getColors)
¥ fix to v. rare menu problem for any menu entry which was purely
  numeric (fixes problem in www menu for certain page titles).
¥ fix for some subtleties around colouring and hiliteWord and
  backwardWord
¥ fix to startup lock on some wm's on unix (thanks Daniel)
¥ more robust fix to menu index issue.  Should resolve a few minor

  encoding.
¥ alphatk can now operate under a general encoding.  The distribution
  will soon shift away from a macRoman encoding.
¥ better balloon help on MacOS (thanks Daniel)
¥ reversed encoding decision.  New windows now do not have an
  encoding.  This means their encoding will only be set when they
  are saved.  This is a much more reasonable approach.
¥ 'revert' is much better now; it doesn't try to recolour the
  entire buffer any more.
¥ page back/forward obey 'move insertion' pref (thanks Craig)
¥ more robust startup, updated to AlphaTcl 7.5a4
¥ much better focus handling when dialogs and status bar interaction
  are over.

  images/icons in menus as used in AlphaTcl (assuming very recent
  version of Tk).

  have different default encodings.
¥ modified url::execute on Windows so it works with urls containing
  ampersands.
¥ added 'sourceforge' menu for interacting with sourceforge.
¥ better behaviour of 'select' with very large ranges (won't scroll
  the window if both ends of range are offscreen).
¥ better workaround for win dnd problem.
¥ better colouring of split windows.

8.1d1 - released 	   	   	   last update: 09/14/2001 {11:07:24 AM}

¥ updates to AlphaTcl library 
¥ beginnings of support for keyboard macros (only a handful of
  commands are recorded at present, however).
¥ to make way for improvements in the editing window, split
  that code into two pieces, and made better separation between
  'generic editing code' and alphatk specific code.
¥ 'select' tries to ensure the entire selection is visible.  This
  means multi-line browse windows work much better, but could potentially
  have some negative side-effects.
¥ greater sharing of standard AlphaTcl key bindings.
¥ killWindow now does an 'update' if it needs to bring another window
  to the front, which fixes a rare problem with switching, killing and
  saveAs'ing windows.
¥ Alt F11 (or Windows menu) now toggles a new margin display of line
  numbers.  In the future this margin may be used interactively
  (e.g. to set breakpoints, etc).
¥ better display of line/column information in status bar.
¥ partial implementation of icGetPref on windows.
¥ better colouring of last line in window
¥ bit of a directory reorganisation
¥ updates to tkdiffControl, etc, and removed tkdiff.exe, since
  the standalone script works fine.

  a .zip archive of all the AlphaTcl libraries.
¥ lots of AlphaTcl changes, many to improve Alphatk.

¥ ftp package now distributed with Alphatk.
¥ fixed rare bug in 'prompt' (thanks)
¥ dialog offsets can be positive.
¥ better drag'n'drop (using tkdnd) and significant AlphaTcl
  improvements.
¥ dialog command more robust.
¥ work around dnd bugs in multi-page dialogs.
¥ reversed priority of Alpha vs AlphaStyle bindings.  Fixes one
  common problem, but must check whether it introduces others.
¥ note that various ctrl-z/x/c etc bindings have gone in this 
  release.  alt-z/x/c are the defaults on that front.
¥ better handling of encodings, especially wrt installers etc.
¥ re-enabled ctrl-z/x/c/v for standard operations on Windows.
  (although note that Alphatk supports alt-z/x/c/v as an alternative
  which does not conflict with emacs-emulation).
¥ better interaction with MikTeX.  Use:
    C:\Apps\Alphatk\runalpha.bat "%f" -line %l
  as your YAP command line, and set the additional tex flags to
  '--src' for this to work.  You may also need to edit the
  runalpha.bat file.
¥ slightly better dnd workaround in dialogs code.
¥ fixed bug in dialogs with password entry side-effects

8.0 - released 	   	   	   last update: 05/16/2001 {17:01:02 PM}

  specific to Alphatk.

¥ updated vfsFileset to handle latest vfs implementation
¥ made Alphatk robust to 'file attributes -longname' not functioning
  on Windows (required for good vfs support).

8.0fc4 - released 	   	   	   last update: 04/27/2001 {12:12:35 PM}

8.0fc1 - released 	   	   	   last update: 03/20/2001 {20:19:26 PM}

¥ added unicode and encodings help file.
¥ simplified some dialogs code, beginnings of support for tabbed
  dialogs.
¥ slightly better dnd support (dragging a file onto the status bar or
  menu bar should work on windows and unix).  Note that most of the
  menu bar is a native-menu on windows, and therefore won't accept
  these kinds of drags.  All of this requires 'tkdnd'.
¥ AlphaTcl up to 7.4.1 (final release).
¥ beginnings of support for a control-bar in the left margin
  (allowing things like line-numbers, debugger breakpoints etc. to
  be displayed).
¥ added row/col display to status bar
¥ ordinary clicking in the red 'modified' status indicator saves the
  window (as well as ctrl-clicking which worked before).
¥ better implementation of the popup mode/encoding menus and the
  position indicator

8.0b3 - released 	   	   	   last update: 01/29/2001 {18:59:37 PM}

¥ usual host of AlphaTcl improvements (now at 7.4fc5 release of that
  library).
¥ better browser support on unix.
¥ more meta keys removed from menus on Windows.
¥ fix small bug in markMenuItem
¥ printing on Windows works for windows which have not been saved.
¥ can now save position, size of menubar, and resizing of menubar
  should work on Windows and Unix.
¥ added some support for 'tkdnd' extension and dropping of files onto
  the menubar or status window to open them, but it doesn't work yet.
¥ small fix to getfile
¥ added proper support for Unicode files.  We can now automatically
  recognise, read in and understand unicode files, in both big- and
  little-Endian formats.  Saving is less well tested, but appears to
  work.

8.0b2 - released 	   	   	   last update: 11/28/2000 {12:14:36 PM}

¥ right-click in text page menu works correctly for files being edited
  remotely (via the ftp menu).
¥ addition of python mode, with modifications to work in Alphatk.
¥ fix for 'edit -c -w' (rare case)
¥ added some support for making Alphatk into a scripted document
  (as in TclKit)
¥ the tmp-file safe saving works around potential issues of the old
  file still existing
¥ added vfsFileset.tcl which allows Alphatk to mount any virtual file
  system supported by the 'vfs' package and edit files with it (of
  course you also need the 'vfs' package).
¥ saving handles weird situations like a directory with the same name
  as the file trying to be saved, and properly aborts attempted saves
  which fail for any reason (previously the user would receive a msg
  that the file hadn't been saved, but the 'dirty' flag would be
  cleared, etc).
¥ better colouring (the rememberWindows package showed up
  a small bug in window colouring).
¥ made default position of status bar under menus -- it's more obvious
  and useful for the newcomer to Alphatk.
¥ better handling of mailto urls.
¥ better watchCursor implementation.
¥ moved default pwd up one level so we're not inside Alphatk
¥ updated for latest 8.4 wm iconbitmap patch syntax on Windows.
¥ can now create program manager groups on startup on windows.
¥ added some dde commands so things like file::showInFinder work
  on Windows.
¥ better mailto support on Unix.
¥ if you have Tkhtml package installed, you can activate the
  tkhtmlViewer package to view .html files in that package from
  within Alphatk.
¥ added some support for embedding Alphatk's windows wherever we
  want.
¥ better colouring with multi-line comments.
¥ small fix to undo/redo code in case of inserting nothing.

8.0b1 - released 	   	   	   last update: 10/27/2000 {15:15:02 PM}

¥ marks menu handles separators better
¥ added support for patched Tk 8.4 with 'winico' support in core WinTk
¥ dde/exec opening of files under Windows is more sophisticated.
¥ some menu separators failed to be separators, now fixed
¥ beginnings of conversion of eudoraMenu into general purpose mailMenu
¥ minor changes for first beta release.

8.0d4 - released 	   	   	   last update: 10/19/2000 {12:57:34 PM}

¥ fix for '\n' bug in Bind -- now an error is thrown for bad input.
¥ 'keyCode', 'keyAscii' mostly implemented.
¥ better colouring with large delete/undo operations.
¥ cosmetic fix to menus (combination of /<! special chars in, e.g.,
  latex menus)
¥ fix to keysym translation problem on unix in latex menu.
¥ better support for status-window embedded in menubar.
¥ changes to startup process, allowing for status-window embedding
  in menubar.  See Preferences->Window to adjust that.
¥ fix to saveAs to ignore illegal characters in file names
  (works around buglet in Tk)
¥ made pixel offset of status bar an early preference, so it doesn't
  jump on startup.
¥ balloon help for status window.
¥ slightly simpler startup process for status window.
¥ fix for IMPORTANT colouring in help files.
¥ licensing fix.

8.0d3 - released 	   	   	   last update: 10/04/2000 {18:57:10 PM}

¥ beginning of support for placing the status bar under the menu bar.
¥ better positioning and sizing of balloon help windows.
¥ multi-line edit widgets now look the same as normal entry widgets.
¥ Added 'remember windows' package which, if you activate it, will
  allow Alphatk to remember position, selection etc of windows even
  after they are closed.
¥ better support for 640x480 screens.  Fixed multi-column bug in helpMenu 
  and occasionally other menus which could crop up on small screens.
  The splash screen is still a little too large for such screens, but
  that is only a minor cosmetic problem.
¥ 'revert' now re-colours window properly afterwards.
¥ workaround for problem with Gnome on Linux at startup.
¥ don't leave last visible line uncoloured
¥ fix problem with focus being lost, at least under Windows, when 
  using the status bar and moving to another application and then
  back to Alphatk.
¥ added 'update' to alertnote so the alert disappears before Alphatk
  proceeds with subsequent actions.
¥ killing a dialog window is now equivalent to 'Cancel', if the dialog
  contains a cancel button.
¥ fixed problem that moving directly from one hypertext label to another 
  would fail to update the message in the status bar.
¥ popup encoding and mode menu are removed when all windows are
  closed.
¥ status prompt fixes in some cases.
¥ fix for convertChars problem in file marking
¥ improved robustness of marks/file/funcs menus

8.0d2 - released 	   	   	   last update: 09/07/2000 {23:32:37 PM}

¥ since Alphatk is now pretty stable, I upped the major version number
  to make progress on more significant changes.  Alphatk 7.3 is by and
  large a superset of the MacOS Alpha 7.3/7.4 (a superset in the sense
  that it does everything 7.3/7.4 do, and adds a lot of what is in the
  unreleased Alpha8.0).
¥ old preferences should be copied over when you upgrade.
¥ moved from FTP to ftp package (in tcllib)
¥ status window is now higher by default, can be moved in 'Windows'
  preferences dialog.  (e.g. if you have your windoze-taskbar
  auto-hiding like me, you'll want to adjust that 'Pixel offset from
  bottom of window' preference to 0 to restore the old behaviour).
¥ after undo makes a window unmodified, redo will still work.
¥ minor updates to various Readme/Installation files.
¥ mark-stack works better
¥ mtime problem fixed (now timezone independent).
¥ support for encodings of windows - you may use the popup encoding
  menu to change a file's encoding on the fly.  Files are
  automatically saved in their current encoding.  There is currently
  no facility to remember a file's encoding between edits.  This will
  be added soon.
¥ avoid long startup-pause when loading gdi/printer extensions on
  Windows and no printer/network is currently available.
¥ alpha::inAlphaHierarchy fixed for case-insensitive windows weirdness
  (use file attributes -longname to get a file's real name)
¥ right-click in a text window is equivalent to Alpha's
  window-title-click, bringing up a popup menu of the window's path
  (Tk is amazing: this only required 12 lines of code!)
¥ numerous small changes for better robustness on Windoze when
  directory names have their case changed without any other
  alterations.
¥ can set a file's encoding via (encoding:enc-name) in the first line
¥ reasonable testing on Linux, so it should run much better under
  that OS now (many annoying/cosmetic problems have been fixed).

7.3 - released 	   	   	   last update: 08/08/2000 {14:39:08 PM}

¥ -f flag to status::prompt/statusPrompt properly implemented.
¥ better status::prompt; code is cleaner now
¥ on MacOS, source -rsrc will work still.
¥ using popup to change mode changes Alphatk's mode bindings too.
¥ updated HTML mode
¥ fixed multisearch bug which sometimes arose in TeX mode.
¥ much better help file marking and hyperlinking.
¥ better command/alt-double-click support.
¥ updated HTML mode (again -- thanks Johan).
¥ better browser invoking on MacOS and Windows.
¥ hundreds of improvements to AlphaTcl library.
¥ comment characters which are regexp senstitive are quoted.
¥ set alphatk icon for dialogs/listpicks (e.g. WinTk 8.4 now
  has full size titlebars even for transient windows).

7.3b18 - released 	   	   	   last update: 06/05/2000 {10:33:57 AM}

¥ The status window hides/appears in sync with the menubar.
¥ version control popup better.  Partial implementation for cvs and
  perforce so far.  Comments, suggestions, code much appreciated.
¥ minor fix to moveWin to cope with Tk peculiarity.
¥ diff mode working again.
¥ auto-loading of images in 'Images' directory.
¥ status-window prompting has better handling of modifier keys.
¥ 'revert' handles duplicate window marks <2> etc.
¥ better handling of colouring of multi-line quoted text.
¥ auto marking/colouring of help files.
¥ better killLine, insertToTop
¥ fix to disabled status of vc popup commands
¥ better balloon help (won't ever be off right edge of screen).
¥ better version of 'display', in accord with insertToTop
¥ associate type with Alphatk works better on Windows.
¥ lines half off bottom of window are coloured now
¥ some dialog improvements (disabled items in popup menus)
¥ implemented dummy removeColorEscapes
¥ updated HTML, CSS modes (many thanks Johan)
¥ added -f to statusPrompt (although ignored).
¥ better keymap support
¥ tab usable in status::prompt now (bad interaction with focusNext
  previously!)
¥ fix to encoding issues on some linux systems (this may require you
  to go to your PREFS directory and manually delete the old cache/
  filesetMenuCache, _snippet_ etc).
¥ button size on mac/unix with default ring should look ok now.
¥ fixed problem with unsaved-changes -> cancel (was removing all 
  bindings from window too early).

7.3b17 - released

¥ Syntax colouring finally handles multi-line comments /*....*/ etc.
  On average I think this addition increases the speed of syntax
  colouring, plus Java, C++ finally look great!
¥ Slightly better implementation of regModeKeywords
¥ Keyboard matching in some dialogs (popup menus, listboxes), so you
  can type an entry and have it selected on the fly (no need to use
  the mouse)
¥ basic use of 'status::prompt' works again (it was inadvertently
  broken by the more advanced use in 7.3b15).
¥ Syntax colouring of multi-line quotes, and better colouring of
  quotes and multi-line comments while the user is typing them in.
¥ I now have an automated upload script, so releases take less of
  my time.

7.3b16 - released

¥ added 'viewable/transient' code to dialog/listpick so we can't ever
  hang the application under some window managers.
¥ minor fix to 'Menu' for items deduced to be checkbuttons because
  of their attached flag.
¥ fix to possible startup menu-bar placement problem under some
  versions of WinTk.
¥ we now use core tclIndex files and formats, and hence do not need
  our own 'unknown'.  We do need to override auto_mkindex/auto_reset
¥ better handling of winico package to work around Tk problems on 
  windows (e.g. wm resizable . 0 0 will reset the icon!).
¥ better handling of syntax-colouring-changes on the fly.
¥ addition of version control popup to each window.  Doesn't actually
  integrate with version control yet...  Added balloon help to various
  popups.
¥ errors are shown in red in the status bar now.
  
7.3b15 - released

¥ better user interaction in the status bar -- in particular
  interactive searches (ctrl-s/r) are much better.
¥ better regModeKeywords so we support new tcl/setext modes, and
  can update on the fly.  Also '-m' better supported.
¥ startup changes so menubar appears earlier, avoiding apparent
  hang when a dialog posting is attempted.
¥ size of '.' window computed via different method, to avoid issues
  with its height being set incorrectly (is menubar part of height
  or not? This varies by platform/window manager).

7.3b14 - released

¥ better dialogs on MacOS
¥ ftpMenu works properly on windows now.  You can use it (or 'Open
  Remote..') to edit files within Alphatk which actually reside on
  a remote ftp site.  They are automatically down/uploaded as 
  appropriate, when you open/save them.
¥ preliminary support for collapsed functions: ctrl-alt/cmd-w will
  collapse/expand a procedure in Tcl mode.
¥ the HOME variable is always set to correct, case-dependent value
  on Windows (other platforms should be ok anyway).
¥ problems with 'focus' with Tk8.3 and Windows fixed. It seems the
  behaviour of 'raise' has changed.  For example 
    'raise .w ; focus .w.text'
  will NOT necessarily set the focus to .w.text.  We now need to separate 
  those two commands with 'update idletasks'.  However things aren't quite
  as simple as that, since a test case seems to work in 8.3, yet
  Alphatk definitely requires the 'update'...
¥ added package require Tk to startup files

7.3b13 - released

¥ Better handling of '{}' funcs menu, to avoid strange glitch in which
¥ fix for supersearch basicBatchSearch for Alphatk
¥ Somewhat better colour/size handling to follow defaults in system
  when it starts up.  Tk doesn't have any events to tell us when the
  system-wide colour scheme changes, so we can't handle that...

7.3b12 - released

¥ Better handling of '{}' funcs menu, to avoid strange glitch in which
  Alphatk thinks the menu has been created, but it somehow hasn't, and
  therefore nothing is posted.
¥ 'Evaluate' handled as in Alpha, so we can now create procs in any
  namespace by 'load enclosing proc' - (alt-ctrl-l on windows).
¥ Fancy new about box and startup splash screen.  Many thanks to 
  flip phillips (one of the Alpha 8 Cabal working on the original Alpha
  on MacOS) for the graphic design.
¥ supersearch package forced to be on (since it's the only way we
  provide search capability in alphatk).
¥ Enter replace string is now keyboard accessible on windows as 
  ctrl-alt-e.

7.3b11 - released

Allow save to pretend to be 'save as' when the window as never been
saved before.
Message when files are saved...
Replacement version of 'tkTextInsert' which doesn't use 'catch'
'balance' (cmd/alt-b) completely implemented now.
The 'funcs' menu {} in C/C++ modes now works nicely (there was a
regexp difference between Alpha 7.x and Tcl 8.x).  The marks menu
still doesn't quite work for these modes.

7.3b10 - released

WWW menu actually works properly now.  You can browse simple web pages
from within Alphatk.  Of course since www menu was created for Alpha,
it provides only limited web page display capabilities.  Using one of
the existing html-widgets for Tk would be much better.
Delimiter matching now checks for unmatched delimiters in all cases,
and throws an appropriate error (should avoid all possible infinite
loops).
Better handling of windows created with strange names (including 
directory delimiters etc.).
Added few more keysyms to those known from MacOS and converted to Tk.

7.3b9 - released

AlphaTcl improvements as ever
Workaround for windoze titlebar fonts not containing ellipsis
Implemented autoSave/changesLim.
Fix to silly problem with submenus whose name contains '.'
Better error reporting when trying to use commands which require
an open window when there isn't an open window.
More robust handling of original icon names for toplevel menus
to avoid possible name clashes with internal submenus.  Avoids
potential infinite loops.
Better beginningOfLine, endOfLine, beginningOfBuffer, endOfBuffer.
Alpha can occasionally get into very long (and perhaps infinite?)
loops searching for matching braces/parentheses etc.  You should
now be able to stop these with Alt-. (Mod1-.).  Actually it doesn't
quite work, because these loops never let the event loop in...
Diff mode handles win pathnames and window movement a little better.
The core .tcl and Help files (which are stored in macRoman encoding),
are now transparently converted to/from that encoding when editing
them using Alphatk.  (They always were decoded when using 'source').
This will form the beginning of encoding support for arbitrary files,
so you can edit any encoding from within Alphatk.
Better compatibility with Alpha w.r.t. 'goto' and stuff like that.
The electric templates stuff should now work very well (before it 
worked ok-ish, with various "quirks").
Cmd-keys now match in dialogs: the first button or checkbutton which
begins with the key pressed is activated (e.g. Alt-S matches the first 
button starting with 'S' on windows).
www menu almost working in Alphatk

7.3b8 - released

I noticed a problem with preferences saving -- it could be possible
for preferences to be saved in two forms, both with and without the
leading '::'.  This could only occur for array element preferences
(e.g. your Current Project if document projects package is on).
To fix this, open your 'arrdefs.tcl' preferences file, and globally
replace '(::' by '('.  The problem should not reoccur.  Alternatively,
simply remove the entire file if you don't mind losing the saved
items.
Improvements to multisearch code (e.g. quick find backwards works).
Better windows-specific file opening code.
Added command in fileUtils menu to associate a given file type with
Alpha (so you can double click on files to open them).  This only
works on Windows right now.  The menu command will associate the
extension of the currently open window with Alphatk.

7.3b7 - released

Exit is ultimately via 'destroy .' not 'exit'.  This works around
a bug in MacTk (it seems), and is perhaps a better way to go all
round.
New options to 'dialog' command to avoid destruction/recreation
of the entire dialog for each 'Set...' button pressed.  Works
for most items now (all except 'SearchPath' prefs, I believe).
'dialog' is also now re-entrant, which makes such hierarchical
dialogs more useful.
Fixed confusion between nativename/not of files after 'saveAs'.
Made listpick dialog scroll to display the selected item.
Windows whose associated files have been modified behind Alphatk's
back now receive a green icon in the top right.
saveAs now defaults to directory of second from top window if top
window hasn't ever been saved.
Learnt some focus/dialog/parent interaction from comp.lang.tcl,
so fixed various dialogs so they have proper parents, and avoids
problems with focus always going to '.'

7.3b6 - released

Better multiline searching, including better handling of patterns
which can match the empty string, even if only in certain locations
(e.g. ^...*$ which can match empty lines of text only).

Further fixes to searching, and colouring: now always uses singleline
searching which means it's fast even if the multiline feature is 
turned on.

7.3b5 - released

Colouring is now much improved (the process has gone through several
iterations in the last few days), so that it's about fast enough to
turn on (on my machine, anyway), and is more accurate than before. 
Text is now coloured when inserted/deleted/undone/scrolled/...  If 
you notice a problem, please report a bug!
Colouring is now on by default.  
'Default' button in dialogs now has -default active in most
cases.  
Some minor tweaks to look and work better on MacOS.
Removed some old code for Tcl8.0 hackery.
Some fixes to code which broke with the mutliline search routines
on. There are probably more problems here.  

7.3b4 - released.

Various improvements to interaction with FTP, browsers etc.
HTML mode works better.
Update to AlphaTcl 7.3

7.3b3 - released.

goto fix for problem introduced in b2
newer metafont mode
keypad bindings now possible
quit now no longer asks for each window whether to save or not
newer HTML mode, which should work better.
better balloon help code
Update to AlphaTcl 7.2.3

7.3b2 - released.

More AlphaTcl changes.
displayMode fix
Fix for strange popup page-names in dialogs
Fixes to Bind, colorTriple, dialog
Radiobutton-type menu items work as expected (e.g. Fileset->Utils->Choose)
Better 'word match' searching (i.e. actually works now)
All text windows now closed on exit before calling quitHook, so any last minute
recent files etc are properly updated.  This also works around a bug
in Tk.
Note new 'useMultilineSearchRoutines' flag in the Windows preferences 
dialog.  For the moment this is off by default, until a final,
quick-as-possible solution is found.  HTML mode, amongst others,
requires it.

7.3b1 - released.

Working HTML mode (thanks to Johan)
More AlphaTcl changes.
Radiobutton support in dialogs

7.3a8 - released.

Many AlphaTcl changes (see "Changes" file).
Better handling of split windows.
Startup fix for unusual alphatk installations (file readlink...)
Bunch of simplifications in internal code.
Fixed for tcl8.2.1 balloon help on Windows (behaviour changed
slightly so update idletasks is needed)
'revert' fixed for windows paths, so multi file batch replacements
will automatically update open windows.  Also revertHook fix.
Colouring is by default off (for reasons of speed).

7.3a7 - released.

Many AlphaTcl changes (see "Changes" file).
Fixes when pasting into read-only window.
Better handling of windows native paths etc in compilation and other
communication with external applications.
Unicode handling much improved.  Alphatk now requires Tcl/Tk 8.1 or
newer.  

7.3a6 - released.

Better handling of native and non-native paths on Windows.
Much better forward/backward word functionality (using Mode-dependent
definitions of words as in Alpha on MacOS).  Syntax colouring of
windows now works pretty perfectly, apart from the speed.
Better window splitting (including via mouse), and more robust
cleanup of Window information after manual destruction (destroy rather
than using Alphatk's menus or gui).  killWindow now only ever called
once per window.  Flag showFullPathsInWindowTitles now available
in Window prefs dialog.  Use native colours more effectively now.
Much better double-click word selection in window.  Better support
for password dialogs.

7.3a5 - released.

Some fixes for Unix.  Focus changes seem to have caused some
minor problems on windows in Tk 8.2.0 which I've fixed. 
regModeKeywords works with -a and other colours too.
spacesToTabs and vice-versa implemented.
Other minor fixes.

7.3a4 - released.

Minimisation/maximisation of menubar does same to all other windows.
Various minor fixes.

7.3a3 - released.

Startup of runalpha.tcl with relative path name of file to edit now
works.

7.3a2 - released.

Many minor bugfixes.

7.3a1 - first public release
