This is a help file for the Metafont mode in Alpha.
This file should be located in the Help subfolder of Alpha's folder to
show up automatically in the Help menu when Alpha is loaded.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
<H2>Introduction<A NAME="anchor1"></A></H2><P>MetafontMode is a mode for the text editor Alpha: it is  designed  to  make
writing, processing and testing  of  Metafont  source  files  much  easier.
Metafont is the programming language written, as a  companion  to  TeX,  by
Donald Knuth in  order to create characters, fonts, font families (and many
other things). <P>Once Metafont mode is installed, the opening of a Metafont source file (i-e
with extension ".mf") invokes a new menu (called Metafont !)  in  the  menu
bar with the following features :
<UL>
	<LI> easy insertion of all the basic  Metafont  commands  (with  electric stops) 
	<LI> syntax coloring
	<LI> capacity to process a source file from  within  Alpha  with  various
  flags, printer modes, input base files
	<LI> editing of the log file
	<LI> capacity to make the pk file, to make the dvi from the generic font,
  to view the dvi;
	<LI> creating and editing the property list for a font
	<LI> capacity to manage ordinary and virtual fonts metrics, converting files 
  with tftopl, pltotf, vptovf and vftovp
	<LI> processing all the source files in a folder
	<LI> file marking
	<LI> ready to use template for new fonts
	<LI> key bindings to choose the processing mode, process files etc.
	<LI> word completion
	<LI> command clicking on keywords and commands (to bring their definition)
	<LI> option clicking on the title bar of a window to bring a list of .mf
  and .log files located at the same level or in a  selected  folder  and
  allowing to edit them.<P></UL><P>As of this release, both CMacTeX Metafont and OzMetafont are supported.<P><H2>Installation<A NAME="anchor2"></A></H2><P><H3>Automatic installation<A NAME="anchor3"></A></H3><P>Open the "OPEN TO INSTALL" file. Opening this file indicates to Alpha  that
a new package has to be installed  :  the  procedure  is  automatic.  Alpha
knows  where to store the different elements of your Metafont Mode package.
 
<H3>Manual installation<A NAME="anchor4"></A></H3>
<UL>
	<LI> put the "Metafont Mode" folder in the "Modes" subfolder  of  the  "Tcl"
folder which is located at the same level as your Alpha application<P>	<LI> put the "Metafont Help" file in the "Help" folder located  at  the  same
level  as your Alpha application. Next time you launch Alpha, you will have
a "Metafont Help" item in the Help menu to edit this file.<P>	<LI> launch Alpha. You have to  rebuild  the  package  indices  and  the  Tcl
ones. "Rebuild Package Indices" is  in  the  Config--"Packages  menu,  and
"Rebuild Tcl Indices" is in the Tcl menu.
 
	<LI> quit Alpha and relaunch it : that's all there is to it. <P></UL><P><H3>After installing<A NAME="anchor5"></A></H3><P>From now on, the opening of any file with the ".mf" extension  will  invoke
the Metafont menu. Have a look at the mode specific  preferences  :  create
or open any  Metafont source file and choose "Preferences..." in the "Mode 
Prefs" submenu of the "Config" menu. You can set, for instance, the  name  
of  the  printer mode corresponding to your printer, or indicate the path  
of a working folder. More explanations below.<P><P><IMG SRC="Images/mfsmenu.gif" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><H2>Description<A NAME="anchor6"></A></H2><P>Description of the Metafont Menu items :<P><DL><P><DT><B>Switch To Metafont	</B><DL><DT>

When pressing the control key "Run a File" becomes "Run Current Folder"
Metafont will execute all the "mf" files in the currently 
selected folder if any. Its name is reflected at the bottom 
of the "Other Files" submenu.</DL><P></DL><P><H3>Choose Metafont Mode  submenu<A NAME="anchor7"></A></H3>
The word mode has a different meaning for Alpha and
for Metafont : here it means the Metafont's printer mode, the 
one you specify when you (or Maketexpk) process a font.
As usual with Metafont if no mode is specified, the 
default is proof. You can choose among the following
list. User Defined should be set in the Current
Mode Prefs : it is the printer mode at your installation.
If you do not know which mode corresponds to your
installation, look in the modes.mf file which comes with your
TeX distribution. You can edit this file directly in Alpha 
from this Metafont Menu (see below).
<P><IMG SRC="Images/mfmode.gif" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><DL><P><DT><B>Proof				</B><DL><DT>
To make proof characters at 2602 resolution (36 pixels per 
point). No tfm file is produced in this mode.</DL><P><DT><B>Smoke				</B><DL><DT>
To make black proof characters. No tfm file 
is produced in this mode.</DL><P><DT><B>Localfont			</B><DL><DT>
Use this mode when you do not know the printer mode's 
name of your installation : if your administrator did his 
job well, the "localfont variable" contains the printer mode.</DL><P><DT><B>User Defined		</B><DL><DT>
Comes as default as canonex : you set here what you want.</DL><P></DL>
	
<H3>Processing Options submenu<A NAME="anchor8"></A></H3>
Define here any particular processing option allowed 
by Metafont.
<P><IMG SRC="Images/mfoptions.gif" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><DL><P><DT><B>Mag...</B><DL><DT>
Default value is 1, which means no magnification.</DL><P><DT><B>Magstep...</B><DL><DT>
Default value is 0, which means no magnification
Note that you choose a magnification either in mag or in magstep : 
if you choose the magstep syntax, any choice you previously made 
with mag will be omitted (and vice versa).</DL><P><DT><B>Base File...</B><DL><DT>
You can specify a particular file (a base file for instance)
which should be input before the file you want to process. Like in
the command line :
<PRE>
 mf \mode=foo ; input somebasefile.mf ; input currentwindowfile.mf
</PRE>
To cancel an input file you have to clear all options (see below the 
menu item "Clear All Options")</DL><P><DT><B>Gfcorners</B><DL><DT>
Option to draw corners at the corners of the box 
containing each character. Works in smoke mode.</DL><P><DT><B>Imagerules</B><DL><DT>
Option to draw the box of each character.</DL><P><DT><B>Nodisplays</B><DL><DT>
Don't show the characters on the monitor : to build fonts 
faster</DL><P><DT><B>Notransforms</B><DL><DT>
Don't calculate any transformation if currenttransform is
identity. To run faster.</DL><P><DT><B>Screenchars</B><DL><DT>
Show each character once it has been calculated.</DL><P><DT><B>Screenstrokes</B><DL><DT>
Show each character stroke after stroke while it is calculated</DL><P><DT><B>Clear All Options	</B><DL><DT>
Cancel all previously selected options.</DL><P></DL><P><H3>Source Files  submenu<A NAME="anchor9"></A></H3>
This submenu contains a hierarchical list of mf source files. You must set the 
path to the folder containing the mf's in the Mode Prefs : the "Source Files"
submenu reproduces the hierarchical structure of this folder.  The
depth of nested subfolders can be set in the Prefs with the "Nesting Depth"
variable. You can change it at any moment. If your main folder is to 
big, you might run into memory problems : this can be solved by 
increasing the memory allocated to Alpha. Choose a folder 
corresponding to your needs, not necessarily the top one.
Choosing any item in the "Source Files" menu will edit the corresponding file.<P><DL><P><DT><B>Rebuild Source List </B><DL><DT>
In case new Otp's have been added, you can update the Otp List 
		with this menu item.</DL><P></DL>
	
	
<H3>Convert Files submenu<A NAME="anchor10"></A></H3>
<P><IMG SRC="Images/mfconvert.gif" ALIGN=bottom></P><P><DL><P><DT><B>Convert gf to pk		</B><DL><DT>
Invokes gftopk to transform the "gf" file produced after a run of
Metafont to the "pk" (packed) format. This procedure reads in the
log file to find the name of the gf file (which  depends  on  the
mode chosen and the mag) : if the log file is missing,  it  won't
work. Note that  with  OzMetafont,  pk  fonts  are  automatically
produced when a source file is processed.</DL><P><DT><B>Convert gf to dvi		</B><DL><DT>
Invokes gftodvi to transform the "gf" file produced after  a  run
of Metafont to a "dvi" (device independant) file. This  procedure
reads in the log file to find the name  of  the  gf  file  (which
depends on the mode chosen and the mag) :  if  the  log  file  is
missing, it won't work. This item  is  present  only  when  using
CMacTeX Metafont.</DL><P><DT><B>View dvi file			</B><DL><DT>
If a dvi file has been produced (see previous item) you can  view
it with the dvi  previewer  (dvipreview  with  CMacTeX,  built-in
previewer with Oz).</DL><P></DL><P>The following items allow you to process a single file or all the 
files in a selected folder :
<DL><P><DT><B>Tfm to pl...			</B><DL><DT>
Prompts the user for a "tfm" file to convert  to  human  readable
format : extension of these files will be "fpl"</DL><P><DT><B>Vf to vpl...			</B><DL><DT>
Prompts the user for a "vpl" file to convert to the corresponding
"tfm" and "vf"</DL><P><DT><B>Pl to tfm...			</B><DL><DT>
Prompts the user for a "pl" file  in  human  readable  format  to
compile a tfm file</DL><P><DT><B>Vpl to vf...			</B><DL><DT>
Prompts the user for "tfm" and  "vf"  files  to  convert  to  the
corresponding "vpl"</DL><P></DL><P><H3>Other Files submenu<A NAME="anchor11"></A></H3><P><DL><P><DT><B>Open Log File			</B><DL><DT>
Edit in Alpha (read-only)  the  log  file  corresponding  to  the
currentwindow and produced by a run of Metafont on  this  current
window.</DL><P><DT><B>Open Property List 	</B><DL><DT>
Open the property list file related to the current window (if  it
exists, i-e if you have already converted the tfm to pl)</DL><P><DT><B>Open Modes.mf			</B><DL><DT>
Edit (read-only) the modes.mf file. It is the file containing the
printer mode definitions for allmost all the available printers.</DL><P><DT><B>Open Plain.mf			</B><DL><DT>
Edit (read-only) the plain.mf file. It is the file containing the
definition of all the basic Metafont macros.
Note : you have to set the paths  to  these  files  in  the  mode
specific preferences when you first use the Metafont Mode.</DL><P><DT><B>Remove Files			</B><DL><DT>
Sub menu to delete several types of files in the current folder :
log, gf, pk, dvi, tfm, vf, pl, vpl. The pl files will be  removed
only if they  have  the  plf  extension  (to  avoid  accidentally
destroying Perl script files)</DL><P><DT><B>Select A Folder...</B><DL><DT>
Use the "Select A Folder..." item to select another folder. If a folder has already been 
	selected, its name will be recalled at the bottom of the "Other Files" 
	submenu. It says either</DL><P><DT><B>No Folder Selected		</B><DL><DT>
If no folder is currently selected.</DL><P><DT><B>Current Folder Is:		</B><DL><DT>
Followed by the name of the currently selected folder</DL><P></DL><P>					
<DL><P><DT><B>New Font Template			</B><DL><DT>
Builds a template for a complete new font source  file.  User  is
asked for the number of characters in the font.</DL><P><DT><B>Make Short Menu / Make Long Menu</B><DL><DT>
Toggle between short and long menu. The long menu adds  a  series
of submenus containing  all  Metafont  commands  (primitives  and
macros from the plain format).</DL><P></DL><P>Any item you  choose  will  be  inserted  in  your  file  at  the
cursor's current position with electric tabs for  those  commands
which need arguments. In some cases, you will be asked to enter a
number (see "makegrid" for instance). All the macros relevant  to
a particular aspect have been    collected    together    in    a
(supposedly) logical way:
<UL>
	<LI> "Boolean"

variants of the macros. For instance, if you hold the option  key
down, "addto contour" will become "addto contour withpen" ;  with
the command key you will get "addto contour withweight"
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><H2>File marking<A NAME="anchor12"></A></H2><P>Various elements are marked   :    macros    definitions,    character
definitions, related  files,  input  files  etc.  and  can  be  easily
accessed through pop-up menus and option or command clicking.<P><H2>The Mark pop-up menu<A NAME="anchor13"></A></H2><P>If you choose to mark your file from the "M" pop-up menu (top right of
your editing window), all the def, vardef and  beginchar  declarations
in your source file  will  be  marked.  Remember  that  the  beginchar
command is customizable (in the Mode Prefs) and any  change  you  make
there will be taken into account for marking.
If the 'Auto Mark' checkbox is checked  in  the  Prefs,  the  file  is
automatically marked at opening.<P><H2>The Functions pop-up menu<A NAME="anchor14"></A></H2><P>The "{}" pop-up menu  (top right of your editing window)  contains the
functions and macros defined in your source file. We list here all the
def, primarydef, secondarydef, tertiarydef and vardef  definitions  as
well as the files input with an "input" command.<P><H2>Command double clicking a word<A NAME="anchor15"></A></H2><P>If you Command-Double-Click on a keyword you  access  its  definition.
This procedure looks first  for  a  definition  in  the  current  file
itself, then in the list of primitives, then  in  the  plain  Metafont
macros file and finally in the other text files located  in  the  same
folder and  called  in  the  current  file  by  an    'input'  command
(typically they are macros files).<P><H2>Option clicking the title bar<A NAME="anchor16"></A></H2><P>If you Option-Click on a the title bar, you get a list of all the  .mf
and .log files located :
<UL>
	<LI> in the "local" folder (folder of your current window). 
	<LI> in the "selected" folder (selected when you process an entire folder 
    with "Run A Folder" or in the "Remove Files" sub menu)<P></UL><P>Selecting any item in this list will open it in a window or bring  its
window to front if it is already open.<P><H2>Completions<A NAME="anchor17"></A></H2><P>There is a set of completion procedures in Metafont  Mode.  To  enable
them, you must activate the "elecCompletion"  package  (in  "Config--"
Preferences--" Menus and Features") and  choose  your  completion  key
(default is F1).<P>Completion will behave differently depending on the context.

	<LI> 1.0b7 -- 04/09/99 -- Improved error handling. Corrected a few bugs.
	<LI> 1.0b8 -- 04/15/99 -- Made "Other Files" submenu dynamic. Includes the name of the current files and rebuilds each time it is necessary : when a window is changed, when a file has been processed etc.
	<LI> 1.0b9 -- 04/17/99 -- Added alternate items in the menu : when pressing the option key, "Run a File" becomes "Run a Folder" etc. We can now process a whole folder, convert all the processed files to pk; all the tfm to pl...
	<LI> 1.0b10 -- 04/19/99 -- Added New Font Template.
	<LI> 1.0b11 -- 04/21/99 -- Added T. Kiffe's new Apple event syntax for CMacTeX Metafont to take the output folder into account.
	<LI> 1.0b12 -- 04/27/99 -- Added support for OzMetafont. Since OzMetafont cannot receive a complete Mf command line through an Apple event, a temporary make file is created and processed by the built-in MakeTeXPk
	<LI> 1.0b13 -- 04/29/99 -- Extended the "make file" technique to a complete folder. Extended it to CmacTeX too. Runs much faster : the user doesn't have anymore to confirm between each run of Metafont.
	<LI> 1.0b14 -- 05/25/99 -- Corrected a bug concerning conversion of tfm to pl.
	<LI> 1.0 -- 05/27/99 -- First public release of metafontMode (version 1.0).
	<LI> 1.01 -- 05/29/99 -- Corrected a minor bug for the Metafont menu to build correctly with the newly released Alpha 7.2.
	<LI> 1.01a -- 09/19/99 -- Corrected a bug due to new Alpha 7.2 syntax : old proc isPositiveInteger is replaced now by is::PositiveInteger.
	<LI> 1.1.1 -- 09/21/99 -- Started a Metapost Mode. This will be a standalone mode so I have to change the name of the procedures in both modes to avoid interferences : all procs follow the "Mf::" naming convention. rearranged the sub-menus.
	<LI> 1.1.2 -- 12/02/99 -- Added a "Convert Gf to Dvi" command (only with CMacTeX) along with a "View Dvi" command in the submenu "OtherFiles" Corrected a bug concerning the paths with the tfm to pl conversion. Corrected multiple tftopl conversion routines.
	<LI> 1.1.3 -- 12/16/99 -- Rewritten code to clarify the outputfolders'mess. A new flag "useWorkFold" has been added : if not set the output folder defaults to the current folder ; if set you can choose a different folder for the output (only with CMacTeX Metafont 2.2.1 or later)
	<LI> 1.1.4 -- 01/12/00 -- Redesigned the "Other Files" menu : it now indicates which is the currently selected folder. Added a few items to the "Remove Files" submenu. Added a userEndchar in the prefs (since there was already a userBeginchar, this is logical) : they are used in the New Font Template (default values are beginchar and endchar) and with the "beginchar...endchar" menu item.
	<LI> 1.1.5 -- 02/12/00 -- Corrected a bug : the vftovp menu item did not work because of a typing error. Added a few keywords met in the pl files for syntax colorizing.
	<LI> 1.1.6 -- 03/07/00 -- Added some menu items concerning pencircle and pensquare : press the option or the command key to get variants. Added a proc to build a penstroke command : use the penstroke item with the option key.
	<LI> 1.1.7 -- 04/18/00 -- Added missing primitives to the Keywords list. Improved the mark file procedure.
	<LI> 1.1.8 -- 05/03/00 -- Added a lot of key bindings. Changed some basic code for future compatibility with Alpha 8 and AlphaTk.
	<LI> 1.2 -- 05/08/00 -- Added Mf::DblClick, Mf::OptionTitlebar, Mf::OptionTitlebarSelect and Mf::parseFuncs ad hoc procs. Modified syntax colorizing to distinguish Metafont primitives from plain format macros.
	<LI> 1.2.1 -- 05/20/00 -- Added a "Source Files" subfolder to list the mf source files on the installation : top level folder is chosen in the mode prefs. Added a flag to en/dis-able this feature. Added completion procs.
	<LI> 1.2.2 -- 06/06/00 -- Improved the file marking proc : now mark the description string of a char if there is one or its character code. Def and beginchar instructions are separated.
	<LI> 2.0 -- 02/13/01 -- Rewritten Metafont Mode to make it compatible with Alpha 7.4 and future Alpha 8. Modernised the Apple Events to make use of the new tclAE library. Reorganized the menu structure and added a Convert File submenu. Possibility to switch between a short and a long menu. Changed license to BSD.
	<LI> 2.0.1 -- 04/04/01 -- Suppressed unnecessary setmode in ShowBindings.
	<LI> 2.0.2 -- 15/07/01 -- Update of obsolete removeArrDef and addArrDef procs. Corrected a bug at startup when user cancels choice of mf app.<P></UL><P><H2>Known problems<A NAME="anchor21"></A></H2><P>With versions of CMacTeX Metafont OLDER  than  2.2.1  (this  is  Metafont's
version number, not CMacTeX version number), the output folder defaults  to
the current window's folder. In this case, don't  change  it  in  the  mode
specific preferences.<P>The file extension for property lists (corresponding to fonts  metrics)  is
'pl' which is the same as the extension of Perl script files :  this  means
that when you open a pl file, it invokes automatically the Perl  menu.  The
only thing you can do is to set Mf mode in the  popup  menu  at  the  right
bottomof the screen.<P>Due to a CMacTeX limitation concerning the tftopl, pltotf  etc.  programms,
it is necessary to quit and relaunch the programms each time they are used.
This leads to a semi-automatic processing of an entire  folder  :  user  is
asked to click each time to guarantee that delays are  sufficient  for  the
applications to perform their tasks. Mf itself is not concerned by this.
So far only CMacTeX Metafont and OzMetafont are supported :  I'll  try
to add support for Textures in the future if there is a demand for it.<P>Please e-mail any problem or bug you encounter : <A HREF="mailto:berdesg@easynet.fr">berdesg@easynet.fr</A><P>Visit my Metafont Web page for updates and the utilities for Alpha page:<P><A HREF="http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/metafont.html">http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/metafont.html</A><P><A HREF="http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/alpha.html">http://perso.easynet.fr/~berdesg/alpha.html</A><P><H2>License and Disclaimer<A NAME="anchor22"></A></H2><P>Copyright : Bernard Desgraupes, 2000, 2001
