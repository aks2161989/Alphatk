<P>
Tcl&AElig; enables Tcl applications on the Macintosh to use AppleEvents for 
communication with other programs and for the AppleEvent Manager to 
communicate with Tcl applications. The nature of the MacOS (at least prior 
to MacOS X) makes it impossible to implement any meaningful 
<CODE>exec</CODE> command. Between <EM>agreeable</EM> applications, 
AppleEvents allow communication of anything that can be passed as an 
argument to a command-line application and much more. The key is to make 
the applications agreeable. Tcl&AElig; is an attempt to get Tcl to support its 
end of the bargain. Tcl&AElig; is complementary to Jim Ingham’s 
Tclapplescript.shlb (included in the Tcl distributions). Depending on your 
task and your relative familiarity with AppleScript and raw AppleEvents, 
you may find one tool or the other preferable.
</P>

<P>
Tcl&AElig; inherits directly from the AppleEvent facilities in the <A 
HREF="http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/">Alpha text editor</A>, as written by Pete 
Keleher and Tim Endres. For many years, Alpha has used Jens Alfke’s <A 
HREF="http://www.mooseyard.com/Jens/Software/">AEGizmos</A> to render the 
pathologically-typed binary data in AppleEvents into a Tcl-manageable 
string form. Unfortunately, while AEGizmos are reasonably easy for humans 
to read, they're not the most convenient format for a computer to 
interpret. Alpha programmers wishing to interact with other programs have 
generally applied regular expressions to these strings (with varying 
degrees of success), in order to extract the information they were 
interested in. Several years ago, I got tired of writing the same 
<CODE>regexp</CODE> expressions and sanity checks over and over, so I set 
out to write a complete AEGizmo parser. This parser, in one form or 
another, has been a part of Alpha for a few years.
</P>

<P>
While this Tcl-based AEGizmo parser works well, it can be incredibly slow. 
A while back, a small group of Alpha’s users and I formed the <A 
HREF="http://www.his.com/jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html">Alpha Cabal</A> to 
assume development tasks from Alpha’s originator, Pete Keleher (Pete has 
irresponsibly decided to procreate and pursue tenure, rather than work on 
Alpha like he’s supposed to). One of my prime interests was in improving 
Alpha’s AppleEvent capabilities. After some initial efforts at speeding up 
the parser, my dain bramage cleared up and I set out to simply expose as 
much of the AppleEvent Manager API to Tcl as possible. By avoiding the 
parsing step, speedups of a hundred-fold are typical. As the project 
progressed, it became clear that this could be a useful tool for any 
Tcl-based program, so I generalized the shared library to work with any Tcl 
8 installation, and Pete generously agreed to let me open-source what was 
left of his code. Many of the design decisions in Tcl&AElig; (see <A 
HREF="#MemoryLeaks">Memory Leaks</A>) reflect the need to achieve (nearly) 
the same results with Alpha 7, Alpha 8, and Wish.
</P>

<P>
You can download the latest version of Tcl&AElig; from <A 
HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tclae/">SourceForge</A>.

<H1><a name="TclAE - How is it installed?">Tcl&AElig; &#8212; How is it installed?</a></H1>

<H2>For use in <A name="For use in versi"
HREF="http://www.his.com/jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html">version 8 of the Alpha text editor</A>, the Wish 
shell, and other Tcl applications</H2>

<P>
Place TclAE.shlb where Tcl can find it, such as in one of the directories 
of <CODE>$tcl_library</CODE> or in the same folder as the application.
</P>

<P>
Invoke the library by calling <CODE>package require tclAE</CODE>.
</P>

<P>
Starting with version 8, Alpha will not work properly if Tcl&AElig; is not 
installed.
</P>

<P>
Tcl&AElig; has been predominantly tested with Tcl 8.4. It may 
work with other versions, but certainly none before Tcl 8.0.

<P>
The supplied TclAE.shlb is ready for use on PowerPC machines. The supplied 
CFM68k shared library is completely untested. I have nothing to run it on, 
so I welcome any user reports. Starting with version 1.1a4, Apple has 
incorporated AEGizmos in the CarbonLib SDK, so a build with that should be 
forthcoming.
</P>

<P>
If you’d like to get a head-start on Carbon, fix whatever (if anything) is 
wrong with CFM68k, or if you'd like to make changes to the library, I've 
provided all of the sources in the :Build: directory, along with a 
CodeWarrior Pro 5 project file. If you’d like to take a stab at building 
under MPW or with the OS X native tools, contact me for an XML export of 
the project file; I’ll help as much as I can and will be happy to include 
any resulting <CODE>makefiles</CODE> in future distributions.
</P>


<UL>
    <LI>Obtain a full Tcl source distribution from the <A 
    HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com/">Tcl Developer Xchange</A> and build at 
    least TclLibraries.π. Tcl&AElig; was originally built against Tcl 8.2, but all 
    recent work has been with versions of Tcl 8.3. Earlier and later versions may 
    work, but haven’t been tested. The <CODE>Tcl_Obj</CODE> and binary 
    facilities of Tcl 8 are a must.
    
    <LI>Obtain <A HREF="http://www.mooseyard.com/Jens/Software/">AEGizmos 
    version 1.4.2</A> from Jens Alfke’s site.
    
    <LI>Obtain FindErrorLib from one of the Mac download archives and follow 
    its installation instructions. This library is useful, but not necessary, 
    so you can remove the appropriate <CODE>#define</CODE> from MW_TclAE.pch if 
    you don’t have the library. Many of the Tcl <CODE>.test</CODE> entries will 
    fail because the error messages will be wrong, but Tcl&AElig; should still work 
    properly in all other respects.
    
    <LI>Run the Build Shared Library AppleScript. This isn’t strictly 
    necessary, but it will automate the setting of Tcl&AElig;’s source tree paths. 
    When prompted for paths, just select the parent folder for the item 
    requested; there's no need to choose a specific source or library folder 
    within that folder.
    
    <LI>When you get a successful build and install message, try it out. 
    There is a folder of Tcl <CODE>.test</CODE> scripts included with Tcl&AElig;. 
    These tests work from either Alpha 8 or any of the Tcl 8 shells; they do 
    not require Tk. I can provide a <CODE>.tcl</CODE> script that permits 
    them to run under Alpha 7.
    
    <LI><EM>Please</EM> tell me about any problems you encounter.
</UL>

<P>
Although not a requirement of use, <EM>please</EM> send me any of your 
changes so that I can incorporate them.
