To Install:

Provided you have Tcl/Tk installed, you don't have to do anything (else see
below).  Place the downloaded hierarchy wherever you like.  Then, if your
environment is set up nicely, just double-click on 'alphatk.tcl' to run
Alphatk.  To open a document with Alphatk do: 'wish runalpha.tcl document'.

On Unix systems, you may wish to rename or make a symlink to alphatk.tcl
called 'alphatk', and make the file executable.  Then a simple 'alphatk' in
your shell will run everything.  You should also make sure that alphatk.tcl
file has Unix eols (i.e. not '\r\n' but '\n' at the end of each line),
otherwise your shell is unlikely to be able to run it correctly (but 'wish
alphatk.tcl' should still work in any case).

On MacOS X, you should make "alphatk.aqua" executable, and should then be
able to use it to run Alphatk.  However, even better is to use the
separate 'Alphatk.dmg' standalone version of Alphatk which behaves
like a proper OS X application. 

Other scripts are provided which might be of interest (alphatk.ksh,
alphatk.tcsh).

Alphatk comes with documentation (in its Help menu).

Installing Tcl/Tk
-----------------

You need to have Tcl 8.4.2 or newer.  

You can download from these links:

Tcl 8.4: http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/downloadnow84.tml

You can get learn more about Tcl at <http://www.tcl.tk/>

Other Tcl-related packages: Alphatk makes use of some standard Tcl
extensions (TclX, ftp, http, tkdnd, tclvfs) if you have them available.
Some of these, for some platforms, are also packaged with Alphatk (in the
Tclextensions directory in the distribution).
